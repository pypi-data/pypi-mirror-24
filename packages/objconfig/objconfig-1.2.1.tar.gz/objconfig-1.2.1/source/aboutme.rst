About The Author
================

I am a wunk (that's a half-wolf, half-skunk) named Asher that lives in a human world.

I am married to Maus Merryjest and live in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado, USA

I consider myself an artist who is able to do very technical things.

I am interested in lots of things, from spirituality to video game design.

I consider myself to have a beautiful life, and I like wonderful friends so in that spirit...
