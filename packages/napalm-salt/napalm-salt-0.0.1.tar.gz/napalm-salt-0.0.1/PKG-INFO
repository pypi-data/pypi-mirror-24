        Salt Basics
        ===========
        
        New to Salt? Check out `this document`_ for a brief introduction to get
        up to speed on the basics.
        
        Test Environment
        ================
        
        Throughout the rest of this document, we’ll set up a test environment to
        run some salt commands against routers. This test environment uses a
        vagrant VM running Ubuntu 16.04, which acts as a salt-master as well as
        a proxy-master, which establishes and maintains connections to the
        routers in order to execute commands on them.
        
        Install Salt
        ============
        
        The simplest way to install Salt is via `salt bootstrap`_. Here’s an
        example of an installation:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            wget -O bootstrap-salt.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com/develop
            sudo sh bootstrap-salt.sh
        
        This will install the ``salt-minion`` and ``salt-proxy`` only, but we
        also want this box to be the ``salt-master``, so we’ll install that:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo sh bootstrap-salt.sh -M
        
        For more specific installation instructions, see the `platform-specific
        instructions`_ from the official Saltstack documentation. Be aware to
        install the master distribution **from the PPA repo**, as on the local
        server will run as Master, controlling the devices as Proxy minions.
        
        CentOS documentation can be found `here`_.
        
        Install NAPALM
        ==============
        
        If NAPALM has never been installed on your system it will need to be
        before napalm-salt can work:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev python-dev python-cffi libxslt1-dev python-pip
            sudo pip install --upgrade cffi
            sudo pip install napalm-junos napalm-iosxr napalm-ios
        
        The easy way: Salt users can install NAPALM through a single command,
        using the `napalm-install Saltstack formula`_. A more detailed usage
        example can be found at:
        https://mirceaulinic.net/2017-07-06-napalm-install-formula/.
        
        Configure Salt Proxy (and Minion)
        =================================
        
        The main configuration file needed to make Salt run as proxy-master is
        located at ``/etc/salt/proxy``. This file should already exist, though
        you may need to create it.
        
        We need to tell the proxy process that the local machine is the
        ``salt-master``, and to turn off multiprocessing. You can add the
        following to the top of your ``/etc/salt/proxy`` file:
        
        ::
        
            master: localhost
            multiprocessing: false
            mine_enabled: true # not required, but nice to have
            pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki/proxy # not required - this separates the proxy keys into a different directory
        
        Additionally, you may want to edit the ``/etc/salt/minion`` file to
        point the master location to itself. This is not necessary, but it
        allows you to target the VM as a minion, i
