Description: Django GOV.UK Forms
        ===================
        
        It should be easy to make a Django-based service that follows Government Digital Services’ style guide and reference materials.
        
        This Django app allows forms to be output using the HTML that can be styled using GOV.UK elements.
        The styles themselves are provided by another package [1]_.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - Install ``django-govuk-forms`` or ``django-govuk-template[forms]``
        - Add ``govuk_forms`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        - Inherit forms from ``govuk_forms.forms.GOVUKForm`` and use widgets from ``govuk_forms.widgets``
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Please report bugs and open pull requests on `GitHub`_.
        
        Use ``python setup.py test`` to run all tests.
        
        This repository does not need to be updated for every release of GDS’s packages, only breaking changes for overridden components may need fixes.
        
        If any localisable strings change, run ``python setup.py makemessages compilemessages``.
        
        Distribute a new version to `PyPi`_ by updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``govuk_forms`` and run ``python setup.py compilemessages sdist bdist_wheel upload``.
        
        To do
        -----
        
        - Allow fields to be grouped into field sets
        - Is HTML creation mechanic good?
        - Support conditionally-revealed input boxes [2]_
