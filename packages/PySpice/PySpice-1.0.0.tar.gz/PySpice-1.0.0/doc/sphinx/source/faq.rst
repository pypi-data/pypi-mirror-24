How to typeset :code:`u_kΩ` or :code:`u_μV` in Python code
  There is three solutions if you don't have these Unicode characters available on your
  keyboard. The first one, is to use the ASCII alternative: :code:`u_kOhm` or :code:`u_uV.`.  The
  second one, is to define macros on your favourite editor.  The last one, is to customise your
  keyboard settings (If your on Linux look at https://www.x.org/wiki/XKB/).
