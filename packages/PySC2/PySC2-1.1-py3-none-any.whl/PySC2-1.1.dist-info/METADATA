PySC2 - StarCraft II Learning Environment

PySC2 is DeepMind's Python component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment
(SC2LE). It exposes Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II Machine Learning API
as a Python RL Environment. This is a collaboration between DeepMind and
Blizzard to develop StarCraft II into a rich environment for RL research. PySC2
provides an interface for RL agents to interact with StarCraft 2, getting
observations and sending actions.

We have published an accompanying blogpost and paper
https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/
which outlines our motivation for using StarCraft II for DeepRL research, and
some initial research results using the environment.
