        \:star\: Installation
        ---------------------
        
        This is a python package available on pypi.
        
        On windows and mac `you can download python3.5 here <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/>`_.
        On linux distros, python3.5 is already on most package managers :smile:
        
        With python3.5 installed just execute::
        
            pip3.5 install katcr
        
        
        If it asks about permissions and you don't know what to do, you should
        probably read `Jamie Matthews's article about virtualenvs <https://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/>`_
        
        
        \:star2\: Notes
        ----------------
        
        This project is made with the best of intentions. For that times
        you need to search for somethink shared as a torrent on KAT
        (I.E, linux images). Logo is based on robot cat by
        `Arsenty <https://thenounproject.com/arsenty/>`_
