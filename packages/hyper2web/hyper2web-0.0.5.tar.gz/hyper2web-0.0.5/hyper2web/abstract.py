This module defines all Abstract Types in the framework.
Mainly for Better Organization of Code and For Better IDE Type Inferences

class AbstractApp:

    This class is the base class of any App classes. The framework provides an `App` class which implements all methods of this class.
    
    A user can also implement this class if the user find that the `App` class is insufficient. But, the creator recommends user to extend `App` class instead of `AbstractApp` class.

    A Response should be constructed by the router.
    The router passes Stream information such as stream id to the Response object
    and Response object is passed to the end point function for top level users' use.
    
    The flow control is handled by the HTTP class. Therefore, a send method always ends the response.

        That means, if you want to send some string, you have to convert the string to bytes.
        The framework does not do type conversion for you. It just fails if incorrect type is passed.
