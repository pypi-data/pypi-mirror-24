The memento_client library provides Memento support, as specified in RFC 7089 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089)

For more information about Memento, see http://www.mementoweb.org/about/.

This library allows one to find information about archived web pages using the Memento protocol.  It is the goal of this library to make the Memento protocol as accessible as possible to Python developers.
