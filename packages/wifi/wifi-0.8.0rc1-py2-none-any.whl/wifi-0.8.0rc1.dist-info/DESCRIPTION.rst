Description: **Note:** This project is unmaintained. While I would love to keep up the
        development on this project, it is difficult for me for several reasons:
        
        1.  I don't have enough time.
        
        2.  I switched to Fedora and the corresponding scripts to manage WiFi are
            completely different. I was looking into re-writing the library in order to
            support more than just Debian based architectures, but it was too involved.
        
        If anybody wants to take over the development of WiFi, please contact me. You
        can find my email in the commit message.

        ----
        
        Wifi provides a command line wrapper for iwlist and /etc/network/interfaces
        that makes it easier to connect the WiFi networks from the command line.  The
        wifi command is also implemented as a library that can be used from Python.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.8.0rc1
        ^^^^^^^^
        :release-date: 2017-08-07
        
        - Add support for sudo
        - Change default command name to `pywifi`, to evade conflicts with other packages
        - Add attribute `frequency_norm` which is the normalized frequency, aka frequency band
          as one would find on packaging of WiFi hardware. Only 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands are
          supported.
        - Fix some typo's in this document and create some more (probably)
        
        0.4.0
        ^^^^^
        :release-date: 2017-07-17
        
        - Internal release only
        - Make the wifi command name configurable (#55 - thanks yourealwaysbe)
        - Add a __main__.py so that wifi can be invoked using python -mwifi
        - Fix argument parsing so that scan is the default argument even with options passed
        - Add preliminary EAP support (#63 - thanks irgusite)
        - Update test suite and overall PEP8 formatting
        - Fix WPA detection
        - Fix relative signal level parsing to not rely on stable dictionary order
        - Centralize code to reformat a passphrase to a psk
        - Add ability to generate a `wpa_supplicant` network configuration from a cell
        - Add parsing for:
          - Group cipher
          - Pairwise ciphers
          - Authentication suites
          Please note that it's likely to be refactored into a separate object, as more then
          one of these triplets may exist for a given cell.
        - Add logging
