Description: wav-loopy
        =========
        A simple WAV audio file looper: read file -> write file looped by X.
        
        The following formats are allowed for X (using input sample size as basis for time):
        
        * Number "1.2": output size is ``X * input size``
        * Time in seconds "20.0s": output size is exactly ``X`` seconds
        * Adition time in seconds "+10.0s": output size is ``input size + X`` seconds
        
        *wav-loopy* also may fade out the last seconds of a track.
