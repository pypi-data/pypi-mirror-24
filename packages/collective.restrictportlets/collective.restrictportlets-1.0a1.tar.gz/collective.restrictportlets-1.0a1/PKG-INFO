        ===========================
        collective.restrictportlets
        ===========================
        
        This packages allows you to restrict the available portlets that non-Managers can add.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - On any page where portlets can be added, the product checks a list of portlets that are restricted to only Managers.
          This includes the personal dashboard.
        
        - There is a control panel for selecting which portlets to disallow for non-Managers.

        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This package is tested on Plone 4.3 and 5.0.
        
        It should be fine for Plone 4.1 and 4.2 as well:
        
        - It patches a method from ``plone.portlets`` that has not changed since version 2.0 (Plone 4.0).
        
        - We need ``plone.app.registry`` for our setting and the control panel, so this means Plone 4.1.
        
        The most important part of this package is a small `monkey patch <https://github.com/collective/collective.restrictportlets/blob/master/src/collective/restrictportlets/patches.py>`_ for ``plone.portlets.manager.PortletManager.getAddablePortletTypes``.
        If you have other code that patches this, it may not work.
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        This package is tested with Travis:

            :target: http://travis-ci.org/collective/collective.restrictportlets
        
        
        Default
        -------
        
        After you install the product in the Plone add-ons control panel, by default these portlets are restricted:
        
        - Classic portlet
        
        - Login portlet
        
        You can make them available again in the *Restrict portlets* control panel.
        
        
        Translations
        ------------
        
        This product has been translated into:
        
        - Dutch (Maurits van Rees)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.restrictportlets by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.restrictportlets
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``.
        Now you can activate it in the add-ons control panel and configure it in the *Restrict portlets* control panel.
