#. Default: "Select portlets that are hidden from normal users in the manage portlets drop down menu. Restricted portlets are still available for Managers. Please note this is not a security feature, it only unclutters the add portlet menu. No permission checks are done: users who know the exact url to the portlet add form can still add restricted portlets. Normal users can also edit restricted portlets already created in the site."
