        Blackhole is an `MTA (message transfer agent)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent>`_ that (figuratively)
        pipes all mail to /dev/null, built on top of `asyncio
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ and utilises `async def <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def>`_
        and `await <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await>`_
        statements available in `Python 3.5
        <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html>`_.
        
        While Blackhole is an MTA, none of the actions performed via SMTP or SMTPS are
        actually processed and no email is delivered.
        
        You can tell Blackhole how to handle mail that it receives. It can accept all
        of it, bounce it all or randomly do either of those two actions.
        
        Think of Blackhole sort of like a honeypot in terms of how it handles mail,
        but it's specifically designed with testing in mind.
