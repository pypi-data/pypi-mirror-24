=============
tls_occlusion
=============

This is a library designed for occlusion analysis of LiDAR simulated data.

Although many functions are very specific to certain types of LiDAR simulation and data conventions, this library can be
easily adapted and extended to fit different scenarios.

This is still a work in progress, requiring some polishing to improve user-friendliness (still lacking documentation), but the core modules are sound and tested.

The tls_occlusion library is being developed as part of my PhD research, supervised by Dr. Mat Disney, in the Department of Geography at University College London (UCL). My research 
is funded through Science Without Borders from the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (10.13039/501100003593) â€“ Brazil (Process number 233849/2014-9).
