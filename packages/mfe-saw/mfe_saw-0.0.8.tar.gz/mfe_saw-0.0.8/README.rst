This project aims to provide a basic API wrapper around the McAfee SIEM API to help make it more 
accessible to as many people as possible. 




Whether it be to add the day's new datasources, querying the raw logs for 200 IP addresses for 
different date ranges or integrating a list of datasources that have been silent the past 24 hours 
into a report, when you're responsible for a repetitive task you should be spending your time automating, 
not repeating. It's time for MFE_SAW!

For SIEM operators, the project includes a CLI front end to automate tasks that would otherwise be time 
consuming or repetitive in the user interface.

For developers, this project attempts to provide a pythonic interface for specific aspects of the product 
including:

* ESM Monitoring
* Datasource Management (add, edit, del - including Client datasources)
* Simplified Query interface [TBD]
* Watchlist Operations [TBD]
 
The first target of this project is datasource management. With this library and accompanied front-end CLI 
interface, datasources can be easily added by putting a few details into a file and dropping into a directory. 
When the script runs, it will check the directory, validate the datasource and add it to the ESM. Client 
datasources are supported also.
