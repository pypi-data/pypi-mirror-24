Description: ====================
        Partial PyPI Mirrors
        ====================
        
        Sometimes you want a PyPI mirror, but you don't want the whole thing. You
        certainly don't want external links. What you want are the things that you
        need and nothing more. What's more, you often know exactly what you need
        because you already have a pip requirements.txt file containing the list of
        things you expect to download from PyPI.
        
        pypi-mirror will build a local static mirror for you based on requirements
        files in git repos.
        
        Use with diskimage-builder
        --------------------------
        
        The config below shows a generic sample config. If you're using this mirror in
        conjunction with diskimage-builder, more specific notes (including some
        pre-requisites and installation instructions) can be found at
        https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/diskimage-builder/tree/elements/pypi/README.md
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        A YAML configuration is needed to create a mirror. Below is an example
        configuration. ::
        
          cache-root: /tmp/cache
        
          mirrors:
            - name: openstack
              projects:
                - https://git.openstack.org/openstack/requirements
              output: /tmp/mirror/openstack
        
            - name: openstack-infra
              projects:
                - https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/config
              output: /tmp/mirror/openstack-infra
        
        
        Creating a mirror
        -----------------
        
        The run_mirror utility creates a mirror. ::
        
          run-mirror -c mirror.yaml
