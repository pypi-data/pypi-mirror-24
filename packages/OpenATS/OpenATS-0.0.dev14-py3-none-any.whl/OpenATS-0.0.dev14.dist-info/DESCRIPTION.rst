====================
Partial PyPI Mirrors
====================

Sometimes you want a PyPI mirror, but you don't want the whole thing. You
certainly don't want external links. What you want are the things that you
need and nothing more. What's more, you often know exactly what you need
because you already have a pip requirements.txt file containing the list of
things you expect to download from PyPI.

pypi-mirror will build a local static mirror for you based on requirements
files in git repos.

Use with diskimage-builder
--------------------------

The config below shows a generic sample config. If you're using this mirror in
conjunction with diskimage-builder, more specific notes (including some
pre-requisites and installation instructions) can be found at
https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/diskimage-builder/tree/elements/pypi/README.md


Configuration
-------------

A YAML configuration is needed to create a mirror. Below is an example
configuration. ::

  cache-root: /tmp/cache

  mirrors:
    - name: openstack
      projects:
        - https://git.openstack.org/openstack/requirements
      output: /tmp/mirror/openstack

    - name: openstack-infra
      projects:
        - https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/config
      output: /tmp/mirror/openstack-infra


Creating a mirror
-----------------

The run_mirror utility creates a mirror. ::

  run-mirror -c mirror.yaml
