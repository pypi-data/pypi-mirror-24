Python II lecture notes
=======================

Supplementary material, lecture notes and exercises for the Python II
lecture at University of Freiburg.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, all lectures are in the *.ipynb* format of version 4.
Therefore you need Jupyter to view them. One would need no installation,
in case the notebooks run without errors. In case the dependencies shall
be installed, this module can be installed using setuptools.

.. code:: bash

    ~$ git clone https://github.com/mmaelicke/felis_python2.git
    ~$ cd felis_python2
    ~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~$ cd lectures
    ~$ jupyter notebook
