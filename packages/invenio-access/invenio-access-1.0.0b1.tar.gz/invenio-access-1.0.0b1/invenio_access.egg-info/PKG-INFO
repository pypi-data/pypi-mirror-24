        Role-based access control (RBAC) for Invenio.
        
        Invenio-Access works together with Invenio-Accounts to provide a full-fledge
        authentication and authorization system for Flask and Invenio based on a suite
        of existing Flask extensions such as:
        
        - Flask-Security
        - Flask-Login
        - Flask-Principal
        - passlib
        
        Features:
        
        * Role-based access control with object level permissions.
        * CLI and administration interface for allowing/denying actions to users, roles
          or system roles.
        * Support for superuser privileges.
