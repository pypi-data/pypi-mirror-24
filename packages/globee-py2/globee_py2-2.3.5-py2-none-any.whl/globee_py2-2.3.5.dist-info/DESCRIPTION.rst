Python Library for integrating with BitPay
-------------------------------------

This library is compatible with Python 2.7.8. It is not compatible with Python 3.

This library is a simple way to integrate your application with
GloBee for accepting bitcoin and altcoin payments. It exposes three basic
functions, authenticating with globee, creating invoices,
and retrieving invoices. It is not meant as a replacement for
the entire GloBee API. However, the key_utils module contains
all of the tools you need to use the GloBee API for other
purposes.
