This directory contains the test suite for cx_Oracle.

The schemas and SQL objects that are referenced in the test suite can be
created by running the SQL script sql/SetupTest.sql. The syntax is:

    sqlplus / as sysdba @sql/SetupTest.sql

The script will create users cx_Oracle and cx_Oracle_proxy. If you wish to
change the names of the users or the name of the edition you can edit the file
sql/TestEnv.sql. You will also need to edit the file TestEnv.py or set
environment variables as documented in TestEnv.py.

The test suite can be run without having cx_Oracle installed by issuing the
following command in the main directory:

    python setup.py test

If cx_Oracle is already installed, you can also run it by issuing the following
command in this directory:

    python test.py

After running the test suite, the schemas and SQL objects can be dropped by
running the SQL script sql/DropTest.sql. The syntax is

    sqlplus / as sysdba @sql/DropTest.sql
