        This extension helps you to play videos on your plone site (Plone 4.3.x) using a very basic setup of jwplayer.
        When inserting a video, you can choose to use a self-hosted jwplayer library or a cloud based library.
        Video is inserted into content only through the TinyMCE editor. So the Products.TinyMCE extension is required to use this extension.
