Description: 
        Wrappers for the "Automator" framework on macOS. The Automator framework
        supports the development of actions for the Automator application, as well
        as the ability to run a workflow in developer applications. An action is
        a bundle that, when loaded and run, performs a specific task.
        
        These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
        for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
        for general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python
        and (Objective-)C frameworks
