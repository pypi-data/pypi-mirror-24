Add virtual makeup to a picture of a face.

### Installation _(MacOS)_

* You need **Python2.7** and `pip` to get this working. MacOS comes with Python2.7 installed by default. If you don't have `pip`, follow these steps to get it - 	
	* `curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py`
	* `sudo python get-pip.py`
	* `pip install --upgrade pip`

* If you don't have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), copy paste the following in your terminal to get it - 
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

* Install **Cmake** - `brew install cmake`

* Install **Boost** and **Boost-Python** - 
	* `brew install boost`
	* `brew install boost-python`

* Kindly consider using a **virtual environment** for development. Check out [**this link**](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to get an idea about how to do that. 

* Install the python module requirements by running - `pip install visage`
