Description: A package to stress one or more cores
        =====================================
        
        ``stressypy`` uses the unix package ``stress`` to stress a certain number of cpus for a certain amount
        of time, as specified by the user. It creates ``JobBlock`` objects which contain pertinent information for using these
        stress loads to test queueing algorithms.
        
        JobBlock Attributes:
        ++++++++++++++++++++
        
        class attributes
        ----------------
        * total_blocks: the number of blocks created
        * waiting_blocks: the number of blocks waiting to be queued - in box
        * queued_blocks: the number of blocks waiting to be executed - in queue
        
        instance attributes
        -------------------
        * n_cpu: number of cpus being stressed
        * t_run: the time it will take to run the job
        * delta_t_run: the time the processor will take to run the job; overhead time
        * state: the state of the block
        * func: the function the block is storing
        * func_args: the arguments for the function the block is storing
        * area: the 'area' as width in cpu vs height in time
        * queue: the queue the block will be sent to
        * job: a combination of the func and arg to return the complete job that the block should execute
        
        
        Installation
        ++++++++++++
        
        ``stressypy`` can be installed with ``pip install stressypy``
        
        or cloned manually and setup with ``python setup.py install``
        
        ``stressypy`` is dependent on the ``stress`` unix package. Make sure you have it installed.

        Directions
        ++++++++++
        
        ``stressypy`` runs using the command ``stressy stress`` with the number of cpus and time passed as arguments
        
        * ``stressy stress 1 1`` stresses 1 core for 1 second
        * ``stressy stress 7 3`` stresses 7 cores for 3 second
