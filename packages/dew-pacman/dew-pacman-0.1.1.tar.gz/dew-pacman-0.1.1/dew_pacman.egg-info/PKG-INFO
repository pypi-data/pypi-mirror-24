        What is this?
        -------------
        Dew is a package manager for C/C++ dependencies. It aims to make dependency management and configuration easier, like what Cargo does for Rust. For each dependency listed in a 'dewfile', Dew downloads the source of the dependency, builds it, and installs it's files in a prefix directory that can be used by your project.
        
        What is supported?
        ------------------
        Right now it supports dependencies built with CMake. Later it will support dependencies built with Make.
        
        Is it stable? Is it a good idea to use this for projects in production?
