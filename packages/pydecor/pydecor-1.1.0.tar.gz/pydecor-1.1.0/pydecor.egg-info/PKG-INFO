Description: 
        Decorators are great, but they're hard to write, especially if you want
        to include arguments to your decorators, or use your decorators on
        class methods as well as functions. I know that, no matter how many I 
        write, I still find myself looking up the syntax every time. And that's 
        just for simple function decorators. Getting decorators to work 
        consistently at the class and method level is a whole 'nother barrel 
        of worms.
        
        PyDecor aims to make function decoration easy and straightforward, so that
        developers can stop worrying about closures and syntax in triply nested
        functions and instead get down to decorating!
