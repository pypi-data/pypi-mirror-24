        A unofficial CLI tool which uses the Quandl API and the Sharadar Essential Fundamentals
        Database to extract financial fundamentals, Sharadar provided ratios as
        well as calculate additional ratios.  Results are
        written to an Excel Workbook with a separate worksheet per ticker analysed.

        Features
        --------
        
        For a given ticker, fundamental data is obtained using the Quandl API and the
        Sharadar Fundamentals database. This data is then used to calculate various
        useful, financial ratios. The ratios provide profitability indicators, a
        number of financial leverage indicators providing a sense of  the amount of
        debt a company has on it's balance sheet as well as its ability to service
        it's debt and pay a dividend.
        
        Some REIT specific ratios  such as FFO and AFFO are roughly approximated.
        These specific ratios are only roughly approximated since certain data, namely
        Real estate sales data for the period does not appear to be available via the
        API.
        
        
        Within each ticker's excel worksheets it's  divided into three main areas:
        
        - Quandl statement indicators. This is data obtained from the three main
          financial statements; the Income Statement, the Balance Sheet and the Cash Flow
          Statement. 
        
        - Quandl Metrics and Ratio Indicators. These are quandl provided financial ratios.
        
        - Calculated Metrics and Ratios. These are calculated by the package from the
          Sharadars data provided and tabulated by the statement indicators and the
          'Metrics and Ratio' indicators.
        
        The python Quandl API provides the ability to return data within python pandas
        dataframes. This makes calculating various ratios as simple as dividing two
        variables by each other.
        
        The calculations support the data offered by the free `SF0
        <https://www.quandl.com/data/SF0-Free-US-Fundamentals-Data/documentation/about#indicators>`_
        database, and the paid for `SF1
        <https://www.quandl.com/data/SF1-Core-US-Fundamentals-Data/documentation/dimensions>`_
        database, a richer set of data is available as well as a larger coverage
        universe of stocks is supported by the paid SF1 database.
