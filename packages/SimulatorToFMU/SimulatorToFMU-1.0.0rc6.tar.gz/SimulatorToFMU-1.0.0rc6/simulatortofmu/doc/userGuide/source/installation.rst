Installation and Configuration
==============================

This chapter describes how to install, configure, and uninstall SimulatorToFMU on Windows and Linux operating systems. SimulatorToFMU is currently not supported on Mac OS.


Software requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To export a Simulator as an FMU, SimulatorToFMU needs:

1. Python and following dependencies:

   - jinja2 
   - lxml 

2. Modelica parser

3. C-Compiler

SimulatorToFMU has been tested with:

- Python 2.7.12 (Linux) and 2.7.13 (Windows) 
- Three Modelica parsers

  - Dymola 2017 FD01 on Windows and Linux
  - JModelica 2.0 on Windows, and JModelica trunk version 9899 on Linux
  - OpenModelica 1.11.0 on Windows

- C-Compiler: Microsoft Visual Studio 10 Professional

.. note:: 

   SimulatorToFMU can use OpenModelica and Dymola to export a Simulator as an FMU. 
   However OpenModelica 1.11.0 (on Windows) and Dymola 2017 FD01 (on Linux) do not copy all required libraries dependencies to the FMU.
   As a workaround, SimulatorToFMU checks if there are missing libraries dependencies and copies the dependencies to the FMU.

.. _installation directory:

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install SimulatorToFMU, proceed as follows:

1. Add following folders to your system path: 

 - Python installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Python27``)
 - Python scripts folder (e.g. ``C:\Python27\Scripts``), 
 - Dymola executable folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files(x86)\Dymola2017 FD01\bin``)
 - JModelica installation folder (e.g. ``C:\JModelica.org-2.0``)
 - OpenModelica executable folder (e.g. ``C:\OpenModelica1.11.0-32bit\bin``)

   
 You can add folders to your system path by performing following steps on Windows 8 or 10:

 - In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
     
 - Click the Advanced system settings link.
     
 - Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables, find the PATH environment variable and select it. Click Edit. 
     
 - In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable (e.g. ``C:\Python27``, ``C:\Python27\Scripts``). Click OK. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK.
     
 - Reopen Command prompt window for your changes to be active.
    
 To check if the variables have been correctly added to the system path on Windows, type ``python``, ``dymola``, ``pylab``, or ``omc``
 into a command prompt to see if the right version of Python, Dymola, JModelica, or OpenModelica starts up.

 .. note:: 

    To avoid adding Dymola, JModelica, or OpenModelica to the system path, provide the path
    to the executables to SimulatorToFMU.py. See :ref:`build_cmd` for the lists of arguments 
    of SimulatorToFMU.

2. Install SimulatorToFMU by running 

 .. code-block:: none

   > pip install SimulatorToFMU
 
 The installation directory should contain the following subdirectories:

 - ``bin/``
   (Scripts for running unit tests)

 - ``doc/``
   (Documentation sources)

 - ``fmus/``
   (FMUs folder)

 - ``parser/``
   (Python scripts, Modelica templates and XML validator files)
   

UnitTests
^^^^^^^^^

To test your installation run from the installation ``bin`` folder

.. code-block:: none

    > python runUnitTest.py 
    

Uninstallation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To uninstall SimulatorToFMU, run

.. code-block:: none

    > pip uninstall SimulatorToFMU
