        <p>Perseus is bringing its primary source texts into
            <a href="http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/texts/cts.html" target="_blank">CTS</a> and
            <a href="http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/index.html" target="_blank">EpiDoc TEI</a> compliance
            in the context of the efforts on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perseids.org">Perseids Project</a>,
            which is funded by the <a href="http://www.mellon.org" target="_blank">Andrew W. Mellon</a> Foundation, and 
            of the Open Philology Project, which is funded by the 
            <a href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/">Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at Leipzig</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Why CTS?
            "Canonical Text Services (“CTS”) is a component of the pioneering CITE architecture developed by the
            Homer Multitext Project. CTS offers several advantages. In brief, CTS URNs allow us to produce a
            semantically meaningful identifier which represents the position of a text in the hierarchy in which it is
            traditionally cited. This same identifier scheme can also be used to cite into the text at the passage
            level, within a specific version or instance of that text, or within the notional work the text represents.
            This permits more precise, refined citation of textual sources and provides a basis for better text
            alignment, text retrieval, and citation.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://capitains.github.io">CapiTainS</a> is a suite of tools and guidelines for the CTS standards.
            The user interface provided here is an extension of the
            <a href="https://flask-capitains-nemo.readthedocs.org" target="_blank">Nemo Flask application</a> and
            the texts are served by the <a href="https://capitains-nautilus.readthedocs.org" target="_blank">Nautilus</a>
            CTS provider. Texts are updated directly from the PerseusDL canonical github repositories as they pass tests
            in the <a href="https://github.com/capitains/hook" target="_blank">Hook Continuous Integration environment</a>.
        </p>
        <p>How does this work relate to the current version of Perseus? Tufts University and the Perseus team are
            committed to maintaining <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu" target="_blank">Perseus 4.0</a> as is.
            The CapiTainS environment, developed through the support of the <a href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/"
            target="_blank">Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig</a>, offers a
            means of demonstrating the on-going text conversion efforts as we move towards a contributor-based model of
            publication. It is our hope that this environment will provide the basis for further collaboration within
            the digital classics and digital humanities communities.
