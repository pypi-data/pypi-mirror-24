        =========
         JekPost
        =========
        A command-line utility to make your Jekyll experience smoother.
        
        STATUS
        =====
        This project is currently in its development stages.
        
        I've been working from a Linux Fedora 24 machine. I honestly have no idea how
        this is going to behave on other operating systems.
        
        USAGE
        =====
        
        Ensure that the directory where you installed JekPost is in your :code:`$PATH`.
        
        To create a new Jekyll post::
        
          $ jekpost_create.py 'Post Title' dir --disqus 'your-disqus-shortname'
        
        :code:`dir` is the directory name where you wish to save the new post to. It
        can also be relative pathnames.
        
        JekPost currently supports adding in an optional Disqus shortname.
