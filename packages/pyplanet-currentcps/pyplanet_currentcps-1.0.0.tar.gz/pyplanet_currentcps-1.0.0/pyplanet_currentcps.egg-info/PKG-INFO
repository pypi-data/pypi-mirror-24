Description: # Currentcps
        PyPlanet cp tracker app
        
        ## Description
        Currentcps is an app for [PyPlanet][pyplanet]. It shows the progress of multiple players
        on the current track. The players are ordered by their current CP and their time at that
        CP.
        
        ### Finished players
        Players that already finished the track are shown first, but only the fastest 5
        finished players are shown. However, each finished player can always see themselves.
        
        ### Restart
        When a player starts to drive and they haven't reached any CP before, they are shown
        with CP 0 and a time of 0:00.000. A player that has already reached a CP before and
        decides to restart is shown with the old CP and time until they pass a CP. The same
        happens with players that have already finished.
