# Currentcps
PyPlanet cp tracker app

## Description
Currentcps is an app for [PyPlanet][pyplanet]. It shows the progress of multiple players
on the current track. The players are ordered by their current CP and their time at that
CP.

### Finished players
Players that already finished the track are shown first, but only the fastest 5
finished players are shown. However, each finished player can always see themselves.

### Restart
When a player starts to drive and they haven't reached any CP before, they are shown
with CP 0 and a time of 0:00.000. A player that has already reached a CP before and
decides to restart is shown with the old CP and time until they pass a CP. The same
happens with players that have already finished.
