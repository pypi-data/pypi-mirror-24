Introduction
============

This library packages `qrious`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`qrious`: https://github.com/neocotic/qrious

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.qrious``) are published to some URL.
