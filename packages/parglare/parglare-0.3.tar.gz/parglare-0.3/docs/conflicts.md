# LR parsing and conflicts resolving

LR parser operates as a deterministic PDA (Push-down automata). It is a state
machine which is always in some state during parsing. The state machine must
deterministically decide what is the next state just based on its current state
and one token of lookahead. This decision is given by LR tables which are
precalculated from the grammar before parsing even begins.

For example, let's see what happens if we have a simple expression grammar:

    E: E '+' E
     | E '*' E
     | number;
    number: /\d+/;

and we want to parse the following input:

     1 + 2 * 3

Language defined by this grammar is ambiguous as the expression can be
interpreted either as:

     ((1 + 2) * 3)

or:

     (1 + (2 * 3))


In the parsing process, parser starts in state 0 and it sees token `1` ahead
(one lookahead is used - LR(1)).

The only thing a parser can do in this case is to shift, i.e. to consume the
token and advance the position. This operation transition the automata to some
other state. From each state there is only one valid transition that can be
taken or the PDA won't be deterministic, i.e. we could simultaneously follow
different paths.

Current position would be (the dot represents the position):

     1 . + 2 * 3

Now the parser sees `+` token ahead and the tables will tell him to reduce the
number he just saw to `E` (a number is an expression according to the grammar).
Thus, on the stack the parser will have an expression `E` (actually LR states
are kept on stack but that's not important for this little analysis). This
reduction will advace PDA to some other state again. Each shift/reduce operation
change state so I'll not repeat that anymore.

!!! note
    See [pglr command](./pglr.md) which can be used to visualize PDA. Try to
    visualize automata for this grammar.


After reduction parser will do shift of `+` token. There is nothing to reduce as
the subexpresison on stack is `E +` which can't be reduced as it's not complete.
So, the only thing we can do is to shift `2` token.

Now, the position is:

      1 + 2 . * 3

And the stack is:

      E + 2

And this is a place where the parser can't decide what to do. It can either
reduce the sum on the stack or shift `*` and `3` and reduce multiplication
first and the sumation afterwards.

If the sum is reduced first and `*` shifted afterwards we would get the
following result:

     (1 + 2) * 3

If the shift of `*` and `3` is done instead of reducing, the reduction would
first reduce multiplication and then sum (reduction is always done on the top of
the stack). We will have the following result:

    1 + (2 * 3)

From the point of view arithmetic priorities, preffered solution is the last one
but the parser don't know arithmetic rules.

If you analyze this grammar using [pglr command](./pglr.md) you will see that
the LR tables have Shift/Reduce conflicts as there is a state in which parser
can't decide whether to shift or to reduce (we just saw that situation).

parglare gives you various tools to be more explicit with your grammar and to
resolve these conflicts.

There are two situations when conflicts can't be resolved:

- you need more than one lookahead to disambiguate,
- your language is inherently ambiguous.

If you end up in one of these situations you should use GLR parsing, which will
fork the parser at each state which has multiple paths, and explore all
possibilities.


## Resolving conflicts

When we run:

    $ pglr -d check expr.pg

where in `expr.pg` we have the above grammar, we get the following output at the end:

    *** S/R conflicts ***
    There are 4 S/R conflicts

    State 6
            1: E = E + E .   {+, *, STOP}
            1: E = E . + E   {+, *, STOP}
            2: E = E . * E   {+, *, STOP}

    In state 6 and input symbol '+' can't decide whether to shift or
    reduce by production(s) '1: E = E + E'.

    State 6
            1: E = E + E .   {+, *, STOP}
            1: E = E . + E   {+, *, STOP}
            2: E = E . * E   {+, *, STOP}

    In state 6 and input symbol '*' can't decide whether to shift or
    reduce by production(s) '1: E = E + E'.

    State 7
            2: E = E * E .   {+, *, STOP}
            1: E = E . + E   {+, *, STOP}
            2: E = E . * E   {+, *, STOP}

    In state 7 and input symbol '+' can't decide whether to shift or
    reduce by production(s) '2: E = E * E'.

    State 7
            2: E = E * E .   {+, *, STOP}
            1: E = E . + E   {+, *, STOP}
            2: E = E . * E   {+, *, STOP}

    In state 7 and input symbol '*' can't decide whether to shift or
    reduce by production(s) '2: E = E * E'.
    Grammar OK.
    There are 4 Shift/Reduce conflicts. Either use 'prefer_shifts' parser mode,
    try to resolve manually or use GLR parsing.


As we can see this grammar has 4 Shift/Reduce conflicts. At the end of the
output we get an advice to either use `prefer_shifts` strategy that will always
prefer shift over reduce. In this case that's not what we want.

If we look closely at the output we see that parglare gives us an informative
explanation why there are conflicts in our grammar.

The first conflict:


    State 6
            1: E = E + E .   {+, *, STOP}
            1: E = E . + E   {+, *, STOP}
            2: E = E . * E   {+, *, STOP}

    In state 6 and input symbol '+' can't decide whether to shift or
    reduce by production(s) '1: E = E + E'.

Tell us that when the parser saw addition — the dot in the above productions
represents all possible positions of the parser in the input stream in this
state — and there is `+` ahead, it doesn't know should it reduce the addition or
shift the `+` token.

This means that if we have an expression: `1 + 2 + 3` should we calculate it as
`(1 + 2) + 3` or as `1 + (2 + 3)`. Of course, the result in this case would be
the same, but imagine what would happen if we had subtraction operation instead
of addition. In arithmetic, this is defined by association which says that
addition if left associative, thus the operation is executed from left to right.

Parglare enables you to define associativity for you productions by specifying
`{left}` or `{right}` at the end of production. You can think of `left`
associativity as telling the parser to prefer reduce over shift for this
production and the `right` associativity for preferring shifts over reduces.

Let's see the second conflict:

    State 6
            1: E = E + E .   {+, *, STOP}
            1: E = E . + E   {+, *, STOP}
            2: E = E . * E   {+, *, STOP}

    In state 6 and input symbol '*' can't decide whether to shift or
    reduce by production(s) '1: E = E + E'.

In the same state, when we saw addition and have `*` ahead parser can't decide.

This means that if we have an expression: `1 + 2 * 3` should we calculate it as
`(1 + 2) * 3` or `1 + (2 * 3)`. In arithmetic this is handled by operation
priority. We want multiplication to be executed first, so we should raise the
priority of multiplication (or lower the priority of addition).



    E: E '+' E  {left, 1}
     | E '*' E  {left, 2}
     | number;
    number: /\d+/;


We have augmented our grammar to state that both operation are left associative,
thus the parser will know what to do in the case of `1 + 2 + 3` or `1 * 2 * 3`
it will reduce from left to right, i.e. prefer reduce over shifts. We also
specified that addition has a priority of 1 and multiplication has a priority of
2, thus the parser will know what to do in case of `1 + 2 * 3`, it will shift
`*` instead of reducing addition as the multiplication should be
reduced/calculated first.

!!! note
    The default priority for rules is 10.

This change in the grammar resolves all ambiguities and our grammar is now
LR(1).


## Dynamic disambiguation / conflict resolution

Priority and associativity based conflict resolution is of static nature, i.e.
it is compiled during LR table calculation and doesn't depend on the parsed
input.

There are sometimes situations when parsing decision depends on the input.

For example, lets say that we should parse arithmetic expression but our
operation priority increase for operations that are introduced later in the
input.

```
1 + 2 * 3 - 4 + 5
```
Should be parsed as:

```
((1 + (2 * (3 - 4))) + 5)
```

While

```
1 - 2 + 3 * 4 + 5
```

should be parsed as:

```
(1 - ((2 + (3 * 4)) + 5))
```

As you can see, operations that appears later in the input are of higher priority.

In parglare you can implement this dynamic behavior in two steps:

First, mark productions in your grammar by `dynamic` rule:

```
E: E op_sum E {dynamic}
 | E op_mul E {dynamic}
 | /\d+/;
op_sum: '+' {dynamic};
op_mul: '*' {dynamic};
```

This tells parglare that those production are candidates for dynamic ambiguity
resolution.

Second step is to register function that will be used for resolution during
parser construction. This function operates as a filter for actions in a given
state and lookahead token. It receives a list of actions and a token ahead and
returns a reduced list of actions. Usually, this function will maintain some
kind of state. To initialize its state at the beginning it is called with (None,
None) as parameters.

```
parser = Parser(grammar, dynamic_filter=dynamic_filter)
```

Where resolution function is of the following form:

```
def custom_disambiguation_filter(action, token, production, subresults, state):
    """Make first operation that appears in the input as lower priority.
    This demonstrates how priority rule can change dynamically depending
    on the input.
    """
    global operations

    # At the start of parsing this function is called with actions set to
    # None to give a change for the strategy to initialize.
    if action is None:
        operations = []
        return

    actions = state.actions[token.symbol]

    # Lookahead operation
    shift_op = token.symbol

    if action is SHIFT:
        if shift_op not in operations:
            operations.append(shift_op)
        if len(actions) == 1:
            return True
        red_op = [a for a in actions if a.action is REDUCE][0].prod.rhs[1]
        return operations.index(shift_op) > operations.index(red_op)

    elif action is REDUCE:

        # Current reduction operation
        red_op = production.rhs[1]
        if red_op not in operations:
            operations.append(red_op)

        if len(actions) == 1:
            return True

        # If lookahead operation is not processed yet is is of higer priority
        # so do not reduce.
        # If lookahead is in operation and its index is higher do not reduce.
        return (shift_op in operations
                and (operations.index(shift_op)
                     <= operations.index(red_op)))
```

This function is a predicate that will be called for each action that is dynamic
(SHIFT action for dynamic terminal and REDUCE action for dynamic productions).
You are provided with enough information to make a custom decision whether to
perform or reject the operation.

Parameters are:

- `action` - either SHIFT or REDUCE constant from `parglare` module,
- `token` - lookahead token,
- `production` - a production to be reduced. Valid only for REDUCE.
- `subresults` - a subresults for the reduction. Valid only for REDUCE. The
  length of this list must be equal to `len(production.rhs)`.
- `state` - LR parser state.

## Lexical ambiguities

There is another source of ambiguities.

Parglare uses integrated scanner, thus tokens are determined on the fly. This
gives greater lexical disambiuation power but lexical ambiguities might arise
nevertheless. Lexical ambiguity is a situation when at some place in the input
more than one recognizer match successfully.

For example, if in the input we have `3.4` and we expect at this place either an
integer or a float. Both of these recognizer can match the input. The integer
recognizer would match `3` while the float recognizer would match `3.4`. What
should we use?

parglare has implicit lexical disambiguation strategy that will:

1. Use priorities first.
2. String recognizers are preferred over regexes (i.e. the most specific match).
3. If priorities are the same and we have no string recognizers use longest-match strategy.
4. If more recognizers still match use `prefer` rule if given.
5. If all else fails raise an exception. In case of GLR, ambiguity will be
   handled by parser forking, i.e. you will end up with all solutions/trees.


Thus, in terminal definition rules we can use priorities to favor some of the
recognizers, or we can use `prefer` to favor recognizer if there are multiple
matches of the same length.

For example:

      number = /\d+/ {15};

or:

      number = /\d+/ {prefer};

In addition, you can also specify this terminal to take a part in dynamic
disambiguation:

      number = /\d+/ {dynamic};
