Description: ``dnacol`` and ``pcol``
        ========================
        
        Color DNA/RNA bases, protein amino acid codes and quality scores in terminal output
        
        About
        -----
        
        This is a python script to color DNA, RNA and protein sequences in the terminal.
        If called using ``dnacol``, it will read lines from STDIN or from a file and color all strings of
        DNA/RNA it can find. In addition, it can also color phred-encoded
        quality scores in FASTQ/SAM files.
        If called using ``pcol``, it will instead color protein sequences encoded as amino acid one-letter codes.

        Format-specific coloring
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        By default, ``dnacol`` will find and color all strings of one or more DNA/RNA letters and
        ``pcol`` will color all strings of the twenty standard amino acid letters.
        However, they will also recognize a few standard file formats and apply more
        targeting coloring. When reading a file, these formats will
        automatically be recognized based on their file extensions. When reading
        from STDIN, ``dnacol`` and ``pcol`` will try to identify the format based on the data
        itself (for FASTQ/SAM/VCF files). The format can also be specified using
        the ``--format`` option.
        
        -  SAM format (``--format=sam``, automatically enabled when filename
           ends in ``.sam`` or a line matching the SAM format is found)
        
           -  Ignore headers, color the SEQ column as DNA and the QUAL column as
              quality scores
        
        -  FASTQ format (``--format=fastq``, automatically enabled when filename
           ends in ``.fastq`` or ``.fq`` or the first four lines match the FASTQ
           format)
        
           -  Color the second line of every read as DNA
           -  Color the fourth line of every read as quality scores
        
        -  VCF format (``--format=vcf``, automatically enabled when filename
           ends in ``.vcf`` or a VCF header line is found)
        
           -  Ignore comments, only color the REF and ALT column
        
        -  FASTA format (``--format=fasta``, automatically enabled when filename
           ends in ``.fasta`` or ``.fa``)
        
           -  Ignore sequence identifiers
        
        
        Colormaps
        ~~~~~~~~~
        The script support different colormaps, which specify a color for each possible letter of the sequence.
        These are shown in ``dnacol --help``. When called using ``dnacol``, the script will use the ``dna_brgy`` colormap by default,
        while ``pcol`` will use the ``protein`` colormap. You can change the ``dnacol`` colormap using a configuration file (see below).
        
        Options
        -------
        
        ::
        
            -w, --wide
                wide output (add spaces around each base)
            -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                file format (auto|text|sam|vcf|fastq|fasta)
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        You can create a configuration file in YAML format called ``/etc/dnacol`` or ``~/.dnacol`` to change the behavior of this script.
        At the moment, the only setting available is the colormap to use for DNA sequences.
        See see ``dnacol --help`` for examples of the colormaps that are available.
        
        To use the ``gbyr`` instead of the ``brgy`` colormap, set the ``dna_colormap`` option like this:
        
        ::
          
          dna_colormap: gbyr
        
        Download/Install
        ----------------
        
        To install, use ``pip``::
        
            pip install dnacol
        
        If the system-wide directory is not writable, you can install to your home directory with::
        
            pip install dnacol --user
        
        Alternatively, you can clone this git
        repository and use the provided ``setup.py`` script.
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/koelling/dnacol.git
            cd dnacol && python setup.py install
        
        ``dnacol`` has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 and 3.6.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        ::
        
            #read gzipped file
            dnacol examples/phix.fa.gz | head
        
            #pipe from stdin
            head examples/reads.txt | dnacol --wide
        
            #use `pcol` for protein sequences
            pcol examples/hras.fa
        
            #use `less -R` to display colors in less
            dnacol examples/phix.fa.gz | less -R
