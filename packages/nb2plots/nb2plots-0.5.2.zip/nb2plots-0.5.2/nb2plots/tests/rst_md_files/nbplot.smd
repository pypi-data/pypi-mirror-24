## Nbplot file

Introducing...

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> a
1
```

... the `nbplot`.

```python
>>> b = 1
>>> a
1
```

If running in the IPython console, consider running `%matplotlib` to enable
interactive plots.  If running in the Jupyter Notebook, use `%matplotlib
inline`.

A block to test line-wrapping:

```python
>>> # Here is a comment line that goes beyond the normal 80 character line wrap to test (non) wrapping
```
