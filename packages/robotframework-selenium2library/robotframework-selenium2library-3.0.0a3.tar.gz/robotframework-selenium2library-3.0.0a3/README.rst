Selenium2Library
================

Selenium2Library is a web testing library for `Robot Framework`_
that uses the Selenium_ tool internally. Starting from version 3.0,
the library is renamed to SeleniumLibrary_ and this project exists
mainly to help with transitioning.

Versions
--------

Selenium2Library 3.0 and newer extend the new SeleniumLibrary_ and thus
contain exactly the same code and functionality. There have been lot of
internal changes in the library, but external functionality provided by
keywords should be fully backwards compatible. Libraries and tools using
Selenium2Library internally may need to be updated to support
Selenium2Library 3, though. Selenium2Library 1.8 is the latest, and last,
legacy version with the old architecture and code.

Selenium2Library 3 supports Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.3 and newer.
Selenium2Library 1.8 supports Python 2.6-2.7.

Installation
------------

The recommended approach to install Selenium2Library, regardless the version,
is using pip_.

Install (or upgrade) the latest Selenium2Library 3 release::

    pip install --upgrade --pre robotframework-selenium2library

Notice that ``--pre`` is required until the final Selenium2Library 3.0.0
version is released.

Install the legacy Selenium2Library 1.8.0 version::

    pip install robotframework-selenium2library==1.8.0
