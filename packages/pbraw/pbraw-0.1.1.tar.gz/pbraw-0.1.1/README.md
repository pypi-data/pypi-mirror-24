## pbraw

This utility library provides a helper to automatically grab plaintexts off pastebins (while it might not do this in the most efficient way) the aim is to retrieve URLs from any provided pastebin extracted using a few built-in heuristics and a site-specific handler (think ubuntu pastebin) or two.
