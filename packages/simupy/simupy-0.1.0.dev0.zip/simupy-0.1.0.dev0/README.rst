SimuPy
======

Overview
--------
SimuPy is a framework for simulating inter-connected dynamical system models. SimuPy is an open source, python based alternative to Simulink. Dynamical system models can be specified as an object with certain parameters and functions as described in  the :doc:`api/api`. Models can also be constructed using symbolic expressions, as in

.. code-block :: python

    from sympy.physics.mechanics import dynamicsymbols
    from sympy.tensor.array import Array
    from simupy.systems import DynamicalSystem

    x = x1, x2, x3 = Array(dynamicsymbols('x1:4'))
    u = dynamicsymbols('u')
    sys = DynamicalSystem(sp.Matrix([-x1+x2-x3, -x1*x2-x2+u, -x1+u]), x, u)

which will automatically create callable functions for the state equations, output equations, and jacobians. By default, the code generator uses a wrapper for ``sympy.lambdify``. You can change it by passing the system initialization arguments ``code_generator`` (the function) and additional key-word arguments to the generator in a dictionary ``code_generator_args``. You can change the defaults for future systems by changing the module values

.. code-block :: python

    import simupy.systems
    simupy.systems.DEFAULT_CODE_GENERATOR = your_code_generator_function
    simupy.systems.DEFAULT_CODE_GENERATOR_ARGS = {'extra_arg': value}

A number of helper classes/functions exist to simplify the construction of models. For example, a linear feedback controller can be defined as

.. code-block :: python

    from simupy.systems import LTISystem
    ctrl = LTISystem(matrix([[-1.73992128, -0.99212953,  2.98819041]]))

(the gains in the example come from the infinite horizon LQR based on the system linearized about the origin.) A block diagram of the feedback control can be constructed

.. code-block :: python

    from simupy.block_diagram import BlockDiagram
    BD = BlockDiagram(sys, ctrl)
    BD.connect(sys, ctrl) # connect the current state to the feedback controller
    BD.connect(ctrl, sys) # connect the controlled input to the system

Initial conditions for systems with non-zero state can be defined and the interconnected systems can be simulated

.. code-block :: python

    sys.initial_condition = np.matrix([5, -3, 1])
    res = BD.simulate(10)

which uses ``scipy.integrate.ode`` to solve the initial-valued problem. The results are an instance of the ``SimulationResult`` class, with array attributes ``t``, ``x``, ``y``, and ``e``, holding time, state, output, and event values at integration time step. The first axis indexes the time step. For ``x``, ``y``, and ``e``, the second axis indexes the individual signal components, ordered first by the order of system addition to the block diagram then according to the system state and output specification. The simulation defaults to the ``dopri5`` solver with dense output, but other solvers and solver options can be passed. 

A number of utilities for constructing and manipulating systems and the simulation results are also included:

- ``process_vector_args`` and ``lambdify_with_vector_args`` from ``simupy.utils`` are helpers for code generation using ``sympy.lambdify``
- ``simupy.utils.callable_from_trajectory`` is a simple wrapper for making polynomial spline interpolators using ``scipy.interpolate.splprep``
- ``simupy.matrices`` includes tools for constructing (vector) systems using matrix expressions and re-wrapping the results into matrix form
- ``simupy.systems.SystemFromCallable`` is a helper for converting a function to a state-less system (typically controller) to simulate
- ``MemorylessSystem`` and ``LTISystem`` are subclasses to more quickly create these types of systems
- ``DescriptorSystem`` is used to construct systems with dynamics of the form ``M(t, x) * x'(t) = f(t,x,u)``. In the future, this form can be used in DAE solvers, etc
- ``DiscontinuousSystem`` is used to construct systems with discontinuities, defined by zero-crossings of the ``event_equation_function`` output.

By choice, control design is outside the scope of SimuPy. So controller design tools (for example, feedback linearization, sliding mode, "adapative", etc) should be in its own library(/ies), but analysis tools that might help in controller design could be appropriate here.

Installation
------------

SimuPy is ``pip`` installable

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install simupy
