        When you install a package via ``pip install --user ...``, any executables get
        placed in a special directory specifically for the intended user. Unfortunately,
        this location is most likely not included in your user's PATH variable. So for
        example if you did ``pip3 install --user hatch`` and then tried to learn more
        about your new tool by doing ``hatch --help``, it would fail to be located.
        See: `<https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3813>`_
        
        pybin solves this problem by providing a small CLI, and corresponding API, to
        locate your Python's user bin and optionally update the user PATH. It supports
        all major operating systems and does not require elevated privileges!
        
            **Fear not, this only modifies the user PATH; the system PATH is never
            touched nor even looked at!**
