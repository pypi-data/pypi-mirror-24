topydo is a powerful and customizable todo.txt application for the console, inspired by the todo.txt CLI by Gina Trapani.

Highlights of the additional features it provides:

* Set due and start dates;
* Multiple UIs (CLI, prompt and a column-based TUI);
* Custom sorting;
* Manage tags;
* Maintain dependencies between todo items;
* Allow todos to recur;
* Some conveniences when adding new items (e.g. adding creation date and use relative dates)
