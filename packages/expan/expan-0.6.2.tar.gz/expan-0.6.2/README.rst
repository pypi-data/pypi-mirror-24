A/B tests (a.k.a. Randomized Controlled Trials or Experiments) have been widely
applied in different industries to optimize business processes and user
experience. ExpAn (**Exp**\ eriment **An**\ alysis) is a Python library
developed for the statistical analysis of such experiments and to standardise
the data structures used.

The data structures and functionality of ExpAn are generic such that they can be
used by both data scientists optimizing a user interface and biologists
running wet-lab experiments. The library is also standalone and can be
imported and used from within other projects and from the command line.

Major statistical functionalities include:

- **feature check**
- **delta**
- **subgroup analysis**
- **trend**


Installation
============

To install ExpAn, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install expan


Usage
=====

To use ExpAn in a project::

    import expan

Some mock-up data:

::

    from expan.core.experiment import Experiment
    from expan.core.util import generate_random_data

    exp = Experiment('B', *generate_random_data())
    exp.delta()



Documentation
=============

The latest stable version is 0.6.2.
