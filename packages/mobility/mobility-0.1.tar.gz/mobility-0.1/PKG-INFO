Description: Mobility
        ========
        
        Mobility is a gem for storing and retrieving translations as attributes on a
        class. These translations could be the content of blog posts, captions on
        images, tags on bookmarks, or anything else you might want to store in
        different languages.
        
        Storage of translations is handled by customizable "backends" which encapsulate
        different storage strategies. The default, preferred way to store translations
        is to put them all in a set of two shared tables, but many alternatives are
        also supported, including [translatable
        columns](http://dejimata.com/2017/3/3/translating-with-mobility#strategy-1) and
        [model translation
        tables](http://dejimata.com/2017/3/3/translating-with-mobility#strategy-2), as
        well as database-specific storage solutions such as
        [jsonb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-json.html ) and
        [Hstore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hstore.html) (for
        PostgreSQL).
