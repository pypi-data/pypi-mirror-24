    '''
    Lea is an abstract class representing discrete probability distributions.

    Each instance of concrete Lea's subclasses (called simply a "Lea instance" in the following)
    represents a discrete probability distribution, which associates each value of a set of
    values with the probability that such value occurs.

    A Lea instance can be defined by a sequence of (value,weight), giving the probability weight 
    of each value. Such probability weights are natural numbers. The actual probability of a
    given value can be calculated by dividing a weight by the sum of all weights. A Lea instance
    can be defined also by a sequence of values, their probability weight being their number of
    occurences in the sequence.

    Lea instances can be combined in arithmetic expressions resulting in new Lea instances, by
    obeying the following rules:

    - Lea instances can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided together,
    through +, -, *, /, // operators. The resulting distribution's values and probabilities
    are determined by combination of operand's values with a sum weighted by probability
    products (the operation known as 'convolution', for the adition case).
    - Other supported binary arithmetic operators are power (**), modulo (%) and
    divmod function.
    - Unary operators +, - and abs function are supported also.
    - The Python's operator precedence rules, with the parenthesis overrules, are fully
    respected.
    - Any object X, which is not a Lea instance, involved as argument of an
    expression containing a Lea instance, is coerced to a Lea instance
    having X has sole value, with probability 1 (i.e. occurrence of X is certain).
    - Lea instances can be compared together, through ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= operators.
    The resulting distribution is a boolean distribution, giving probability of True result
    and complementary probability of False result.
    - Boolean distributions can be combined together with AND, OR, XOR, through &, |, ^
    operators, respectively.

    WARNING: the Python's and, or, not, operators shall NOT be used on Lea instances because
    they do not return any sensible result. Replace:
           a and b    by    a & b
           a or b     by    a | b
           not a      by    ~ a

    WARNING: in boolean expression involving arithmetic comparisons, the parenthesis
    shall be used, e.g. (a < b) & (b < c)

    WARNING: the augmented comparison (a < b < c) expression shall NOT be used.; it does
    not return any sensible result (reason: it has the same limitation as 'and' operator).

    Lea instances can be used to generate random values, respecting the given probabilities.
    There are two Lea methods for this purpose:
    - random:   calculates the exact probabiliy distribution, then takes random values 
    - randomMC: takes random values from atomic probabiliy distribution, then makes the 
                required calculations (Monte-Carlo algorithm)
    The randomMC is suited for complex distributions, when calculation of exact probability
    distribution is intractable. This could be used to provide an estimation of the probability
    distribution (see estimateMC method).

    There are nine concrete subclasses to Lea, namely:
      Alea, Clea, Flea, Flea1, Flea2, Glea, Ilea, Rlea and Blea.
    
    Each subclass represents a "definition" of discrete probability distribution, with its own data
    or with references to other Lea instances to be combined together through a given operation.
    Each subclass defines what are the (value,probability) pairs or how they can be generated (see
    _genVPs method implemented in each Lea subclass). The Lea class acts as a facade, by providing
    different methods to instantiate these subclasses, so it is usually not needed to instantiate
    them explicitely. Here is an overview on these subclasses, with their relationships.

    - An Alea instance is defined by explicit value-probability pairs. Each probability is defined as
    a positive "counter" integer, without upper limit; the actual probability is calculated by
    dividing the counter by the sum of all counters; values having null probability counters are
    dropped.

    Instances of other Lea's subclasses represent probability distributions obtained by operations
    done on existing Lea instance(s). Any such instance forms a tree structure, having other Lea
    instances as nodes and Alea instances as leaves. This uses "lazy evaluation": actual (value,
    probability) pairs are calculated only at the time they are required (e.g. display, query 
    probability of a given value, etc); then, these are aggregated in a new Alea instance. This 
    Alea instance is then cached, as an attribute of the queried Lea instance, for speeding up next
    queries.
    
    Here is a brief presentation of these Lea's subclasses: 

    - Clea provides the cartesian product of a given sequence of Lea instances
    - Flea applies a given n-ary function to a given sequence of n Lea instances
    - Flea1 applies a given 1-ary function to a given Lea instance
    - Flea2 applies a given 2-ary function to two given Lea instances
    - Glea applies n-ary functions present in a given Lea instance to a given sequence of n Lea instances
    - Ilea filters the values of a given Lea instance according to a given Lea instance representing a boolean condition (conditional probabilities)
    - Rlea embeds Lea instances as values of a parent Lea instance 
    - Blea defines CPT, providing Lea instances corresponding to given conditions (used for bayesian networks)

    Note that Flea1 and Flea2 are more efficient alternatives to Flea-based implementation.

    WARNING: The following methods are called without parentheses:
        mean, var, std, mode, entropy, information
    These are applicable on any Lea instance; these are implemented and documented in the Alea class.

    Short design notes:
    Lea uses the "template method" design pattern: the Lea base abstract class calls the following methods,
    which are implemented in each Lea's subclass: _clone, _getLeaChildren, _genVPs and _genOneRandomMC.
    Excepting the afore-mentioned estimateMC method, Lea performs EXACT calculation of probability distributions.
    It implements an original algorithm, called the "Statues" algorithm, by reference to the game of the same name;
    this uses a variable binding mechanism that relies on Python's generators. To learn more, see doc of
    Alea._genVPs method as well as other Xlea._genVPs methods implemented in Lea's subclasses.
