# A TOY EXAMPLE: Fibonacci
# This file exists to demonstrate how to use the collab library.

# this program implements the fibonacci sequence.
# It takes up to two files as input, which should contain a number each.
# It creates a new file and writes the next number in the sequence to it.
# Then, this program asks the Execution Environment to call this program again on the newly generated file and the last previous one.
