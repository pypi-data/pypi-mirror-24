r"""
A Local-best Particle Swarm Optimization (lbest PSO) algorithm.

Similar to global-best PSO, it takes a set of candidate solutions,
and finds the best solution using a position-velocity update method.
However, it uses a ring topology, thus making the particles 
attracted to its corresponding neighborhood.

The position update can be defined as:

.. math::

   x_{i}(t+1) = x_{i}(t) + v_{i}(t+1)

Where the position at the current timestep :math:`t` is updated using
the computed velocity at :math:`t+1`. Furthermore, the velocity update
is defined as:

.. math::

   v_{ij}(t + 1) = m * v_{ij}(t) + c_{1}r_{1j}(t)[y_{ij}(t) − x_{ij}(t)] + c_{2}r_{2j}(t)[\hat{y}_{j}(t) − x_{ij}(t)]

However, in local-best PSO, a particle doesn't compare itself to the
overall performance of the swarm. Instead, it looks at the performance
of its nearest-neighbours, and compares itself with them. In general,
this kind of topology takes much more time to converge, but has a more
powerful explorative feature.

In this implementation, a neighbor is selected via a k-D tree
imported from :code:`scipy`. Distance are computed with either
the L1 or L2 distance. The nearest-neighbours are then queried from
this k-D tree.

An example usage is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyswarms as ps
    from pyswarms.utils.functions import single_obj as fx

    # Set-up hyperparameters
    options = {'c1': 0.5, 'c2': 0.3, 'm': 0.9, 'k': 3, 'p': 2}

    # Call instance of LBestPSO with a neighbour-size of 3 determined by
    # the L2 (p=2) distance.
    optimizer = ps.single.LBestPSO(n_particles=10, dims=2, **options)

    # Perform optimization
    stats = optimizer.optimize(fx.sphere_func, iters=100)
