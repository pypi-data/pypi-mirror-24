Description: Python-office365 - Office365 for your server
        ===========================================
        
        The objective of office365api is to make it easy to make scripts and
        applications that are to be run against an Office 365 account.
        
        If you wanted to script retrieving an email it could be as simple as:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from office365api import Mail
            auth = ('YourAccount@office365.com', 'YourPassword')
            mail = Mail(auth=auth)
            messages = mail.inbox.get_messages()
        
        And sending an email like this.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from office365api import Message, Mail
            from office365api.model import Recipient, EmailAddress
            auth = ('YourAccount@office365.com', 'YourPassword')
            message = Message(Subject='Heads up', Body='First automated alarm.',
                From=Recipient(EmailAddress=EmailAddress(Name='Full Name', Address='you@gmail.com')),
                ToRecipients= [Recipient.from_email(email='somebody@gmail.com')]
                )
                
            m = Mail(auth=auth)
            m.send_message(message)
