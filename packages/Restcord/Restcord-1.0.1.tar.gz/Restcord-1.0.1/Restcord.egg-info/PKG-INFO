        Restcord is a rest API wrapper for the Discord API, but this one doesn't include WebSockets, this is for people who dont want websockets but only make requests to the api.
        
        ### Breaking Changes
        
        The discord API is constantly changing and the wrapper API is as well.
        
        ## Installing
        
        To install the library, you can just run the following command:
        
        ```
        pip install -U restcord
        ```
        
        Please note that on Linux installing voice you must install the following packages via your favourite package manager (e.g. `apt`, `yum`, etc) before running the above command:
        
        - python<version>-dev (e.g. `python3.5-dev` for Python 3.5)
        
        ## Quick Example
        
        ```py
        import restcord
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 3.4.2+ (There will be no effort to add support for lower versions)
        - `aiohttp` library
        
        Usually `pip` will handle these for you.
