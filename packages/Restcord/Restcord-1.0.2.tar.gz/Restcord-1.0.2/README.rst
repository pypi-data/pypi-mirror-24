Restcord is a rest API wrapper for the Discord API, but this one doesnâ€™t
include WebSockets, this is for people who dont want websockets but only
make requests to the api.

Breaking Changes

The discord API is constantly changing and the wrapper API is as well.

Installing

To install the library, you can just run the following command:

::

    pip install -U restcord

Please note that on Linux installing voice you must install the
following packages via your favourite package manager (e.g. ``apt``,
``yum``, etc) before running the above command:

-  python-dev (e.g. ``python3.5-dev`` for Python 3.5)

Quick Example
-------------

.. code:: py

    import restcord

Requirements
------------

-  Python 3.4.2+ (There will be no effort to add support for lower
   versions)
-  ``aiohttp`` library

Usually ``pip`` will handle these for you.
