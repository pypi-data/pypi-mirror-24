Description: Stylo
        ---------
        
        Stylo is a framework that attempts to allow users to easily describe the
        contents of an image using a blend of Python and Mathematics. It also provides
        tools that allow for easy parameterisation of the contents of an image opening
        up the possibilities for the creation of animations.
        
        One of the design goals is to minimise the amount of code needed from the user
        to achieve the desired result.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This framework is Python 3 only, and has the following dependencies:
        
        - Numpy
        - Pillow
        - Matplotlib
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Stylo is available on PyPi and can easily be installed using Pip:
        
        .. code::
        
            $ pip install stylo
        
        Alternatively you can grab the latest source code using Git:
        
        .. code::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/alcarney/stylo
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Once installed it's relatively straightforward to get started - provided you
        are familiar with a few concepts from mathematics such as Cartesian and Polar
        coordinates.
        
        Here is a 'Hello World' example where we draw Pacman::
        
        .. code::
        
            from stylo import Image, cartesian, polar, between
        
            @cartesian()
            @polar()
            def pacman(x, y, r, t):
                return r <= 0.8 and not between(-0.6, t, 0.6)
        
            @pacman.colormap
            def color():
            return (255, 255, 0)
        
            img = Image(512, 512)
            img(pacman)
            img.save('pacman.png')
