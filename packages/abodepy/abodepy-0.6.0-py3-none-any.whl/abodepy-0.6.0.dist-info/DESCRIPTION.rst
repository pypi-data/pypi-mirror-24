Thank you Abode for having a relatively simple API to reverse engineer. Hopefully in the future you'll
open it up for official use.

API calls faster than 60 seconds is not recommended as it can overwhelm Abode's servers. Leverage the cloud push
event notification functionality as much as possible. Please use this module responsibly.

You can also block and listen for all device change events::

    $ python abodecl.py --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --listen

        No devices specified, adding all devices to listener...
        Listening for device updates...
        Device Name: Alarm area_1, Device ID: area_1, Status: standby, At: 2017-05-27 11:13:08
        Device Name: Garage Door Deadbolt, Device ID: ZW:xxxxxxxx, Status: LockOpen, At: 2017-05-27 11:13:31
        Device Name: Garage Entry Door, Device ID: RF:xxxxxxxx, Status: Open, At: 2017-05-27 11:13:34
        Device Name: Garage Entry Door, Device ID: RF:xxxxxxxx, Status: Closed, At: 2017-05-27 11:13:39
        Device Name: Garage Door Deadbolt, Device ID: ZW:xxxxxxxx, Status: LockClosed, At: 2017-05-27 11:13:41
