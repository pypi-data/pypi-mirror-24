Description: GitFiles_Ctx
        ============
        
        The broad intent is to provide a Git repository context at the file
        level (over SSH).  In essence on entering the context, a path to an
        ephemeral cleartext tree (top of master) of the remote repository will
        be returned, and on exit that same tree will be removed.
        
        Intended use is for system configuration data maintained and managed
        via Git -- ie update the data in git and the dependent tools
        reconfigure to match when they run, sort of using Git as a hacky etcd.
