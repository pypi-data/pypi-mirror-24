What's new in glue v0.10?
=========================

Below we list some of the main changes in glue v0.10 and in the 3D viewers in
glue-vispy-viewers v0.7. As a reminder, you can easily update glue if you are
using Anaconda/Miniconda, by doing::

    conda install -c conda-forge glueviz

If instead you installed glue with pip, you can update with::

    pip install glueviz[all] --upgrade

Note that the 3D viewers (provided by the
`glue-vispy-viewers <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-vispy-viewers>`_
plugin package) are now automatically installed when installing glue as above.

In addition to a number of bug fixes and small usability improvements, the
following changes are:

Improved linking dialog
-----------------------

The data linking dialog has been redesigned and improved:

.. image:: images/v0.10/link_window.png
   :align: center
   :width: 900

In particular, it is now clear in the list of links which components correspond
to which datasets. This also fixes previous undesirable behaviors such as
components changing names when using the identity link, and such as components
being shown alphabetically instead of in their original native order (which has
now been fixed). Linking functions can also be grouped by categories.

New data/subset exporters
-------------------------

It is now possible to easily export datasets and subsets by right-clicking (or
control-clicking) on them and selecting **Export Data** or **Export Subsets**.

.. image:: ../customizing_guide/images/export_data.png
   :align: center
   :width: 450

Custom data/subset exporters can be easily be defined by users - see
:ref:`custom_data_exporter` for more details. Currently only a small number of
formats are supported by default but this will be expanded in future.

Performance improvements
------------------------

Performance has been significantly improved (in some cases by factors of 10-100)
for cases where 2D datasets were linked with 3D or higher-dimensional datasets,
and selections were made in 2D.

Ginga plugin now moved to a separate package
--------------------------------------------

The plugin that allows `ginga <https://ejeschke.github.io/ginga/>`_ viewers to
be used inside glue has been moved to a new package,
`glue-ginga <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/glue-ginga/0.1>`_. To install
this plugin, simply do::

    pip install glue-ginga

Compatibility with PyQt5 and Matplotlib 2.x
-------------------------------------------

Glue and the 3D viewers are now fully compatible with PyQt5 and Matplotlib 2.x,
which together provide sharper plots on high DPI (e.g. retina) displays.

Creating subset states for categorical components [advanced]
------------------------------------------------------------

For users who like to create subsets programmatically or in the built-in
IPython console, it is now possible to create subset states for categorical
components using e.g.::

    d.id['source'] == 'name'

Subsets now share more attributes with parent Data objects [advanced]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

:class:`~glue.core.subset.Subset` objects now have properties such as
``components``, ``visible_components``, ``ndim``, ``shape``, and more which are
inherited from parent datasets.

Full list of Changes
--------------------

In addition to the above features, a number of bugs has been fixed since the
last release, and a few other small features have been added. A full list of
changes can be found in the
`CHANGES.md <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`_ file
