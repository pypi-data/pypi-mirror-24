What's new in Glue v0.8?
========================

Below we list some of the main changes in Glue v0.8. As a reminder, you can
easily update glue if you are using Anaconda/Miniconda, by doing::

    conda install -c conda-forge glueviz

If instead you installed glue with pip, you can update with::

    pip install glueviz --upgrade

Playback controls for image slicing
-----------------------------------

When using the image viewer to view datasets with more than two dimensions, the
sliders snow include playback controls that you can use to animate the slicing.

By clicking multiple times on the play forward or play back button (the buttons
on either side of the stop button), you can speed up the animation.

Improved new component window
-----------------------------

The *Define New Component* window has now been significantly improved. The
syntax of the expression for the new component is now validated on-the-fly, and
the component cannot be created until the expression validates:

Adding data to glue from Python
-------------------------------

If you make use of the :func:`~glue.qglue` function to launch glue from IPython
or the Jupyter notebook, you can now easily continue to add data to glue from
that Python session, by doing e.g.::

    >>> app = qglue(data1=array1)
    >>> app.add_data(data2=array2)

More details can be found :ref:`here <add_data_qglue>`.

New preferences dialog
----------------------

A new dialog for preferences is now available via **File -> Edit Preferences**,
and allows you to change the settings for the foreground/background color of
viewers, as well as the default data color and transparency:

Improved feedback window
------------------------

The *Send Feedback* functionality available through the Help menu and the window
to send crash reports to the developers now also provide the option to specify
an email address in case you want to be contacted about the feedback/bug report:

Circular and polygonal profile extraction
------------------------------------------

The spectrum/profile extraction tool for the image viewer now supports
extraction using circular and polygonal regions.
