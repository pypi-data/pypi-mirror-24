Installation
------------

Unzip the .zip file into a suitable directory and run python XAFSmassQt.py.

You may want to run python setup.py install in order to have the XAFSmassQt
package in a usual location.

The main file to run is XAFSmassQt.py. On Windows, give it a .pyw extension to
suppress the console window.
