bibtools: a command-line bibliography manager
*********************************************

This is ``bib``, a command-line bibliography manager. It retrieves fulltext
articles, manages their storage on disk, and maintains a database of their
bibliographic information.


============
Installation
============

The most recent stable version is available on the `Python package index`_, so
you should be able to install this package simply by running ``pip install
bibtools``. The package is also available in the `conda`_ package manager by
installing it from `anaconda.org`_::

  conda install -c pkgw bibtools

If you want to download the source code and install ``bibtools`` manually, the
package uses the standard Python `setuptools`_, so running ``python setup.py
install`` will do the trick.
