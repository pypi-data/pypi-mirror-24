# Spyder notebook plugin

Spyder plugin to use Jupyter notebooks inside Spyder. Currently it supports
basic functionality such as creating new notebooks, opening any notebook in
your filesystem and saving notebooks at any location.

You can also use Spyder's file switcher to easily switch between notebooks
and open an IPython console connected to the kernel of a notebook to inspect
its variables in the Variable Explorer.
