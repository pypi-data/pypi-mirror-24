Description: 
        Wrappers for the "SearchKit" framework on macOS. SearchKit is a content
        indexing and search solution.
        
        These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
        for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
        for general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python
        and (Objective-)C frameworks
        
        NOTE: These wrappers are pretty fragile, sadly enough not all run-time
        information that needed to build reliable wrappers is exported from
        the framework.
