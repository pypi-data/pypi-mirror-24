Notes
=====

Serve a robots.txt file from Trac. Mostly useful to tracd users, but works on
anything. Just put the data you want in the wiki page ``RobotsTxt``.

Configuration
=============

To enable the plugin::

    [components]
    robotstxt.* = enabled

A typical ``RobotsTxt`` wiki page will look like::

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /browser
    Disallow: /log
    Disallow: /changeset
    Disallow: /report
    Disallow: /newticket
    Disallow: /search
