Photon is a data driven tool designed to run workflows against an AZ using
Ansible.

A workflow is comprised of one more more playbooks, each configurable
with its own flags and options to be passed down to underlying call to
``ansible-playbook``. It supports the ability to resume a workflow from any
point in the event of a playbook failure.

Quick Start
===========

Create a file called ``photon.yml`` and define at least one AZ and workflow.

.. code-block:: yaml

    azs:
      proxmox:
        inventory: path/to/inventory
    workflows:
      test_password_playbooks:
        playbooks:
          - path: playbooks/tests/update_passwords.yml

.. important::
    ``azs.<name>.inventory`` is the only required value when defining an AZ.
    ``workflows.<name>.playbooks`` is the only required value when defining a
    workflow.

To execute a workflow against an AZ, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ photon test_password_playbooks proxmox
