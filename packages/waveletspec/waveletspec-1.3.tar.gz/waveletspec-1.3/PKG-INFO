        A code to determine the atmospheric parameters of FGK stars from
        echelle spectra. 
        
        This code provide command line functions to load in, normalise and clean spectra from
        a variety of instruments. This code also compares wavelet coefficients to a grid of
        stellar models to determine the best fitting atmospherioc parameters.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The spectral processing scripts are backended with iSpec scripts:
        
        >> http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ASInC..11...85B
        
        I do not own their scripts and use them simply to pre-process spectra. I created a 
        python 3 version of their scripts using 2to3:
        
        >> (https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html)
        
        and changing a few module imports to their Python 3 counterparts.

        1. If you are having gcc issues installing mlpy in Ubuntu, have a look at:
           https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11494179/gsl-error-while-installing-mlpy
        
           The basic summary is that the experimental gsl headers need installing:
        
           >> sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev  
        
           Running the setup scripts again in a new terminal should install it.
