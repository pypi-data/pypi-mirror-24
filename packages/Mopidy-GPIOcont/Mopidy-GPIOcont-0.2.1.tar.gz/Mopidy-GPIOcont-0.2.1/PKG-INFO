        This is an extension for Mopidy to control your music via buttons. There are 4 dedicated playlist buttons, when pressed
        a playlist starts. Volume control is done via a rotary encoder and the LCD screen displays relevant information.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            pip install Mopidy-GPIOcont
        
        Or, if available, install the Debian/Ubuntu package from `apt.mopidy.com
        <http://apt.mopidy.com/>`_.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for
        Mopidy-GPIOcont to your Mopidy configuration file (Note that the list_name are strings and should not be followed by a space)::
        
            [gpiocont]
            enabled = true
            play_pin = 4
            next_pin = 23
            prev_pin = 24
            vol_a_pin = 17
            vol_b_pin = 18
            vol_bounce_time = 10
            vol_change = 2
            list1_pin = 6
            list2_pin = 13
            list3_pin = 19
            list4_pin = 26
            list1_name = Awesome Mix Vol.1
            list2_name = Awesome Mix Vol.2
            list3_name = Heerenhuis UU7
            list4_name = Loge, koffie!
            lcd_enable = true
            lcd_address = 38
            lcd_port = 1
        
        The configuration shown here is also the default configuration. Below is an explanation for each setting
        (Pins are in BCM mode you can see `here <http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/12967>`_  what your pin numbers are.).
        
        Since Mopidy-GPIOcont uses the internal pullup resistors of your Raspberry, buttons should be connected as:
        
        [Pin] -> [Button] -> [Ground].
        
        Configuration options
        =====================
        Not all config values have to be set, below is an explanation for each configuration value.
        
        REQUIRED
        
        ``enabled``: If the extension is enabled or not.
        
        ``list<i>_name``: Name of your dedicated playlist (no trailing spaces).
        
        ``lcd_address``: Address of your LCD screen on the I2C bus. Hexadecimal without the leading "0x".
        Can be found with ``sudo i2cdetect -y 1`` or ``sudo i2cdetect -y 0``.
        This command uses the i2c-tools ``sudo apt-get install i2c-tools``.
        
        OPTIONAL (Else default values are used)
        
        ``play_pin``: Location of your play/pause button.
        
        ``next_pin`` and ``prev_pin`` : Location of your next and previous button.
        
        ``vol_a_pin``: Location of channel A of your rotary encoder (also sometimes CLK).
        
        ``vol_b_pin``: Location of channel B of your rotary encoder (also sometimes DT).
        
        ``list<i>_pin``: Location of your dedicated playlist buttons.
        
        ``lcd_enable``: If you want to enable your LCD screen.
        
        ``lcd_port``: Port of the I2C bus (0 for RasPi 1 and 1 for Raspi 2/3).
        
        
        These two settings have to be adjusted to fit your rotary encoder if your volume control is not working well.
        
        ``vol_bounce_time``: Time in milliseconds to wait before another edge is detected on channel A.
        
        ``vol_change``: Change in volume (up/down) per detected edge on channel A.
