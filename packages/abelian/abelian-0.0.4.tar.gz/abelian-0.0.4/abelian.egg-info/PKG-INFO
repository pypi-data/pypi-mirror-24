        ``abelian`` is a Python library for computations on locally compact Abelian groups.
        Please see `the documentation <http://abelian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
        
        Project Goals
        ==============
        
        * Classical groups R, T, Z and Z_n and computations on these.
        * Relationship between continuous and discrete should be 'pretty'.
        * FFT computations on discrete, compact groups (and their products).
        * The software should build on the mathematical theory.
        
        
        Todo
        ============
        
        * Create skeleton for project
        * Factorizations of homomorphisms between FGAs (tests, docs, implementation)
