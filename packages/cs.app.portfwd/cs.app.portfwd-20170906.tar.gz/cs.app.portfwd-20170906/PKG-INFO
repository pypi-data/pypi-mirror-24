Description: Portfwd runs a collection of ssh tunnel commands persistently,
        each it its own `cs.app.svcd <https://pypi.org/project/cs.app.svcd>`_ instance
        with all the visibility and process control that SvcD brings.
        
        It reads tunnel preconditions from special comments within the ssh config file.
        It uses the configuration options from the config file
        as the SvcD signature function
        thus restarting particular ssh tunnels when their specific configuration changes.
        It has an "automatic" mode (the -A option)
        which monitors the desired list of tunnels
        from status expressed via `cs.app.flag <https://pypi.org/project/cs.app.flag>`_
        which allows live addition or removal of tunnels as needed.
