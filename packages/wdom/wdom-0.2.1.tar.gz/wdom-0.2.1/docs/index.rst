   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. note::
   This document is build by `sphinx`_ with customized `alabaster`_ theme.
   Since the theme has been modified overall by using flexbox, the page layout
   may be broken in some browsers. If you find any broken layout/page, `please
   let me know <https://github.com/miyakogi/wdom/issues>`_ which page is broken
   and which browser you use.
