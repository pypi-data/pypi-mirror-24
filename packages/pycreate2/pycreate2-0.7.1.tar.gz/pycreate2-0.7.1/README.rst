    :target:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycreate2

A python library for controlling the `iRobot Create 2 <http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx>`_.

**Still a work in progress**

Install
------------

pip
~~~~~

The recommended way to install this library is::

	pip install pycreate2

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to develop and submit git-pulls, you can do::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2
	cd pycreate2
	pip install -e .

Unit Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

	nosetests -v -w tests test.py
	python3 -m nose -v -w tests test.py

Use
-------------

.. code-block:: python

	from  pycreate2 import Create2
	import time

	# Create a Create2.
	bot = Create2()

	# Start the Create 2
	bot.start()

	# Put the Create2 into 'safe' mode so we can drive it
	# This will still provide some protection
	bot.safe()

	# Tell the Create2 to drive straight forward at a speed of 100 mm/s
	bot.drive_straight(100)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Tell the Create2 to drive straight backward at a speed of 100 mm/s
	bot.drive_straight(-100)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Turn in place
	bot.drive_turn(100, 0)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Turn in place
	bot.drive_turn(-100, 0)
	time.sleep(4)

	# Turn in place
	bot.drive_turn(100, 0)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Stop the bot
	bot.drive_stop()

	# query some sensors
	sensor_pkts = [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]  # ir bump sensors
	ir = bot.query_list(sensor_pkts, 12)

	# Close the connection
	# bot.close()

Modes
~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walchko/pycreate2/master/pics/create_modes.png
	:align: center

The different modes (OFF, PASSIVE, SAFE, and FULL) can be switched between by calling different
commands.

- **OFF:** The robot is off and can charge, it will accept no commands
- **PASSIVE:** The robot is in standbye and can charge. It will send sensor packets, but will not move
- **SAFE:** The robot will not charge, but you full control over it with a few exceptions. If the cliff sensors or wheel drop sensors are triggered, the robot goes back to PASSIVE mode.
- **FULL:** The robot will not charge and you have full control. You are responsible to handle any response due to cliff, wheel drop or any other sensors.

Sensor Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some of the more useful sensor packets.

================ =============== =================
Sensor           Range           Packet Numbers
================ =============== =================
ir bumper        [0-127]         45
ir bumper        [0-4095]        46-51
encoder          [-322768-32767] 43,44
current          [-322768-32767] 23
voltage          [0-65535]       22
motor current    [-322768-32767] 54,55
battery charge   [0-65535]       25
battery capacity [0-65535]       26 (doesn't change?)
cliff            [0-1]           9-12
cliff signal     [0-4095]        28-31
overcurrents     [0-29]          14
bump wheeldrops  [0-15]          7
================ =============== =================

You can call these individually with ``get_packet()`` or several of them using ``query_list()``.

To Do
------

- Figure out how to handle senors better
- Most people follow iRobots insane naming convention (there might some thought behind it, but I don't see it), maybe break from it and replace with some common sense
- Still working out the syntax, need to make more examples
- Need to write some tests for python 2 and 3
- Need to setup static code analysis
- Need to setup travis.ci ... but need tests to run :)
- Need a monitoring window to show sensor values/states
