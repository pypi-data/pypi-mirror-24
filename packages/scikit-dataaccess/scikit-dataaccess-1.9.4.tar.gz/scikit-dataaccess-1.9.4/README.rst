Scikit Data Access
==================

Advantages of skdaccess - API to import a data generator + function to
get next data chunk (configurable) - Eliminates the need to create
parsers for each data set and simplifies the construction of scientific
data processing pipelines. - Enables studies involving data fusion and
cross-comparisons from several sources. - Skip parser development,
dealing with physical file formats, etc. - Can be used to download data
locally or to a cloud node (e.g., Amazon Cloud). This feature simplifies
distributing entire data sets or partitions of data to the cloud, and
enables parallel processing in cloud computing environments. - Easy
expansion for more data sets in the future - Skdaccess code is open
source (MIT License)

The package introduces a common namespace and currently supports the
following data sets: - Light curves from *Kepler* - Water depth from
wells in California obtained from the USGS - GPS time series data from
the UNAVACO Plate Boundary - Grace Tellus Monthly Mass Grids from JPL
