Description: exguard - Guard code against exceptions, e.g. for running untrusted module code in a framework
        ==============================================================================================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        exgurd provides a decorator to guard a function or method against
        exceptions. This is useful in situations where untrusted code is
        executed, e.g. when executing a third-party module in a framework.
        
        In comparison to the `suppress` context manager from Python 3, exguard
        provides more means to control exception handling:
        
        - filter on modules and namespaces to define which exceptions to catch
          and leave exceptions in other code untouched
        - execute a callback function once an exception was caught
        - execute a callback function in the `finally` block
        
        For example, an API method in a web application that calls through to
        code in third-party modules can be guarded against exceptions in this
        modules only, while having exceptions in the framework itself be raised
        verbatim::
        
            from exguard import guard, traceback_str
        
            def throw_to_client(exception, module):
                tb = traceback_str(exception)
        
                # Do something to pass a traceback to the browser, disable the plugin,â€¦
                pass
        
            # All third-party modules are under one namespace
            @guard(modules=["myframework.plugins"], submodules=True, fullstack=True, cb_except=throw_to_client)
            def call_plugin_api():
                # An exception inside this will be caught
                myframework.plugins.evil.crash()
        
                # This will still raise an exception like normal
                x = 17 / 0
