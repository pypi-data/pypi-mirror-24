exguard - Guard code against exceptions, e.g. for running untrusted module code in a framework
==============================================================================================

Description
-----------

exgurd provides a decorator to guard a function or method against
exceptions. This is useful in situations where untrusted code is
executed, e.g. when executing a third-party module in a framework.

In comparison to the `suppress` context manager from Python 3, exguard
provides more means to control exception handling:

- filter on modules and namespaces to define which exceptions to catch
  and leave exceptions in other code untouched
- execute a callback function once an exception was caught
- execute a callback function in the `finally` block

For example, an API method in a web application that calls through to
code in third-party modules can be guarded against exceptions in this
modules only, while having exceptions in the framework itself be raised
verbatim::

    from exguard import guard

    def throw_to_client(exception, module):
        # Do something to pass a traceback to the browser, disable the plugin,â€¦
        pass

    # All third-party modules are under one namespace
    @guard(modules=["myframework.plugins"], submodules=True, fullstack=True, cb_except=throw_to_client)
    def call_plugin_api():
        myframework.plugins.evil.crash()
