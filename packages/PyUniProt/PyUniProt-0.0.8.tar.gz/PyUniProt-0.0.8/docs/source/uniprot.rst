Citation from `UniProt website (about) <http://www.uniprot.org/help/about/>`_ [08/11/2017]:
    "The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data.
    The UniProt databases are the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and
    the UniProt Archive (UniParc).

    UniProt is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of
    Bioinformatics and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). Across the three institutes more than 100 people are
    involved through different tasks such as database curation, software development and support.

    EMBL-EBI and SIB together used to produce Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL, while PIR produced the Protein Sequence
    Database (PIR-PSD). These two data sets coexisted with different protein sequence coverage and annotation
    priorities. TrEMBL (Translated EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library) was originally created because sequence
    data was being generated at a pace that exceeded Swiss-Prot's ability to keep up. Meanwhile, PIR maintained
    the PIR-PSD and related databases, including iProClass, a database of protein sequences and curated families.
    In 2002 the three institutes decided to pool their resources and expertise and formed the UniProt consortium.

    The UniProt consortium is headed by Alex Bateman (PI), Cathy Wu, and Ioannis Xenarios, supported by key staff,
    and receives valuable input from an independent Scientific Advisory Board."

.. note::

    Please note that PyUniProt not covers all parts of UniProtKB. UniRef and UniParc are in the moment not acessible
    via the library. Only Swiss-Prot is included, TrEMBL will follow in the next version of PyUniProt.
