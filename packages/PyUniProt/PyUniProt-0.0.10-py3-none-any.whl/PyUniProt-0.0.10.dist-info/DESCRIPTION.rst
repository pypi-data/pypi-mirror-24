`PyUniProt <http://pyUniProt.readthedocs.io>`_ is a Python package
to access and query UniProt data provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI),
the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the Protein Information Resource (PIR).

Data are installed in a (local or remote) RDBMS enabling bioinformatic algorithms very fast response times
to sophisticated queries and high flexibility by using SOLAlchemy database layer.
PyUniProt is developed by the
`Department of Bioinformatics <https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics.html>`_
at the Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing
`SCAI <https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en.html>`_
For more in for information about pyUniProt go to
`the documentation <http://pyUniProt.readthedocs.io>`_.

This development is supported by following `IMI <https://www.imi.europa.eu/>`_ projects:

- `AETIONOMY <http://www.aetionomy.eu/>`_ and
- `PHAGO <http://www.phago.eu/>`_.

Supported databases
-------------------

`PyUniProt` uses `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.readthedocs.io>`_ to cover a wide spectrum of RDMSs
(Relational database management system). For best performance MySQL or MariaDB is recommended. But if you have no
possibility to install software on your system SQLite - which needs no further
installation - also works. Following RDMSs are supported (by SQLAlchemy):

1. Firebird
2. Microsoft SQL Server
3. MySQL / `MariaDB <https://mariadb.org/>`_
4. Oracle
5. PostgreSQL
6. SQLite
7. Sybase

Getting Started
---------------
This is a quick start tutorial for impatient.

Installation |pypi_version| |python_versions|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PyUniProt can be installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyuniprot

If you fail because you have no rights to install use superuser (sudo on Linux before the commend) or ...

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user pyuniprot

If you want to make sure you are installing this under python3 use ...

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install pyuniprot

SQLite
~~~~~~
.. note:: If you want to use SQLite as your database system, because you ...

    - have no possibility to use RDMSs like MySQL/MariaDB
    - just test PyUniProt, but don't want to spend time in setting up a database

    skip the next *MySQL/MariaDB setup* section. But in general we strongly recommend MySQL or MariaDB as your
    relational database management system.

If you don't know what all that means skip the section *MySQL/MariaDB setup*.

Don't worry! You can always later change the configuration. For more information about
changing database system later go to the subtitle *Changing database configuration*
`Changing database configuration <http://pyuniport.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
in the documentation on readthedocs.

MySQL/MariaDB setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Log in MySQL as root user and create a new database, create a user, assign the rights and flush privileges.

.. code-block:: mysql

    CREATE DATABASE pyuniprot CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pyuniprot.* TO 'pyuniprot_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pyuniprot_passwd';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

There are two options to set the MySQL/MariaDB.

1. The simplest is to start the command line tool

.. code-block:: sh

    pyuniprot mysql

You will be guided with input prompts. Accept the default value in squared brackets with RETURN. You will see
something like this

.. code-block:: sh

    server name/ IP address database is hosted [localhost]:
    MySQL/MariaDB user [pyuniprot_user]:
    MySQL/MariaDB password [pyuniprot_passwd]:
    database name [pyuniprot]:
    character set [utf8]:

Connection will be tested and in case of success return `Connection was successful`.
Otherwise you will see following hinte

.. code-block:: sh

    Test was NOT successful

    Please use one of the following connection schemas
    MySQL/MariaDB (strongly recommended):
            mysql+pymysql://user:passwd@localhost/database?charset=utf8

    PostgreSQL:
            postgresql://user:passwd@localhost/database

    MsSQL (pyodbc needed):
            mssql+pyodbc://user:passwd@database

    SQLite (always works):

    - Linux:
            sqlite:////absolute/path/to/database.db

    - Windows:
            sqlite:///C:\absolute\path\to\database.db

    Oracle:
            oracle://user:passwd@localhost:1521/database

2. The second option is to start a python shell and set the MySQL configuration.
If you have not changed anything in the SQL statements above ...

.. code-block:: python

    import pyuniprot
    pyuniprot.set_mysql_connection()

If you have used you own settings, please adapt the following command to you requirements.

.. code-block:: python

    import pyuniprot
    pyuniprot.set_mysql_connection(host='localhost', user='pyuniprot_user', passwd='pyuniprot_passwd', db='pyuniprot')

Updating
~~~~~~~~
The updating process will download the *uniprot_sprot.xml.gz* file provided by the UniProt team on their ftp server
`download page <ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/>`_

.. warning::

    Please note that UniProt download file needs ~700 Mb of disk space and the update takes ~2h only for
    human, mouse and rat (depending on your computer)

It is strongly recommended to restrict the entries liked to specific organisms your are interested in by parsing a list
of NCBI Taxonomy IDs to the parameter `taxids`. To identify correct NCBI Taxonomy IDs please go to
`NCBI Taxonomy web form <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/>`_. In the following example we use 9606 as identifier
for Homo sapiens, 10090 for Mus musculus and 10116 for Rattus norvegicus.

There are two options to import the data:

1. Command line import

    .. code-block:: sh

        pyuniprot update --taxids 9606,10090,10116

2. Python

    .. code-block:: python

        import pyuniprot
        pyuniprot.update(taxids=[9606, 10090, 10116])

We only recommend to import the whole UniProt dataset if you don't want to restrict your search. Import with no
restrictions will take several hours and take a lot of disk space.

If you want to load all UniProt entries in the database:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyuniprot
    pyuniprot.update() # not recommended, please read the notes above

The update uses the download file if it still exists on you system (~/.pyuniprot/data/uniprot_sprot.xml.gz). If you use
the parameter `force_download` the current file from UniProt will be downloaded.

.. code-block:: python

    import pyuniprot
    pyuniprot.update(force_download=True, taxids=[9606, 10090, 10116])

Quick start with query functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initialize the query object

.. code-block:: python

    query = pyuniprot.query()

Get all entries

.. code-block:: python

    all_entries = query.entry()


Use parameters like gene_name to find specific entries

.. code-block:: python

    >>> entry = query.entry(gene_name='YWHAE', taxid=9606, recommended_short_name='14-3-3E', name='1433E_HUMAN')[0]
    >>> entry
    14-3-3 protein epsilon

Entry is the root element in the database. Form here you can reach all other data
    >>> entry.accessions
    [P62258, B3KY71, D3DTH5, P29360, P42655, Q4VJB6, Q53XZ5, Q63631, Q7M4R4]
    >>> entry.functions
    ["Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both ..."]

If a parameter ends on a **s** you can search
    >>> alcohol_dehydrogenases = q.entry(ec_numbers='1.1.1.1')
    >>> [x.name for x in q.get_entry(ec_numbers='1.1.1.1')]
    ['ADHX_RAT', 'ADH1_RAT', 'ADHX_HUMAN', 'ADHX_MOUSE']
    >>> query.entry(ec_numbers=('1.1.1.1', '1.1.1.2'))
    ['Adh5', 'Adh1', 'ADH5', 'Adh5', 'Adh6', 'ADH7', 'Adh7', 'Adh7', 'Adh1']

As dataframe with a limit of 10 and accession number starts with Q9 (% used as wildcard)

.. code-block:: python

    >>> query.accession(as_df=True, limit=3, accession='Q9%')
       id accession  entry_id
    0   1    Q9CQV8         1
    1  32    Q9GIK8         6
    2  33    Q9TQB4         6
