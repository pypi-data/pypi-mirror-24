Direct communication from python to node
****************************************
This module was written to handle communication on a moteino network. `Moteinos <http://lowpowerlab.com/moteino>`_
are great little arduino clones that have an onboard RFM69 which gives them wireless  capabilities. This makes them great for home automation or similar situation.

This module assumes a setup of the form:

BaseMoteino should be programmed with the BaseSketch that can be found on the `GitHub <https://github.com/Steinarr134/moteinopy>`_
site. Note that you will have to edit it to match your radio settings.
I recommend reading through the examples scripts on GitHub to see how to use the module
