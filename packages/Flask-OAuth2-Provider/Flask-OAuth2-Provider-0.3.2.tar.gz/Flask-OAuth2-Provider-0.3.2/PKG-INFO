Description: A simple flask oauth2 provider
        ================================
        
        This project aims to be lightweight oauth2 provider for flask based
        applications. It uses JWT (PyJWT) to create tokens and thus it does not need
        any storage for the tokens.
        
        Functionality now is rather limited - just password and client credentials
        grant authorization + token refresh. The other parts of ouath2 process and some
        documentation are coming soon.
        
        The project is still in alpha state, API might change a bit in future.
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        Best way is to use *pip*.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          pip install Flask-OAuth2-Provider
        
        Make html documentation
        ========================
        
        Doc is "in construction" mode but most of code is documented even with some
        example usage. The general overview how to integrate all this into your
        code is a task to be done.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          cd docs
          make html
        
        And then open it as file in you favorite browser. :)
        
        Issues
        =======
        
        Currently there is no way how to revoke tokens and since we use JWT this
        probably will be fixed.
