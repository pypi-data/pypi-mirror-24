Description: django-feed-manager is an application for Django which manages different RSS feeds and their lifetime.
        
        This application has been developed to gather results of recurrent and automatized actions by multiple servers and allow different users to be updated using a standard format (which then allow automatic treatment of the notifications).
        
        Feeds and feed's items can be created using HTTP Post requests. A cli python script is given in this repository to do that for you.
