PyCWT
=====

A Python module for continuous wavelet spectral analysis. It includes a
collection of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via FFT
algorithm. In addition, the module also includes cross-wavelet transforms,
wavelet coherence tests and sample scripts.

Please read the documentation `here <http://pycwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__\.

This module requires ``NumPy``, ``SciPy``, ``tqdm``. In addition, you will 
also need ``matplotlib`` to run the examples.

The sample scripts (``sample.py``, ``sample_xwt.py``) illustrate the use of
the wavelet and inverse wavelet transforms, cross-wavelet transform and
wavelet transform coherence. Results are plotted in figures similar to the
sample images.
