# TOUGHRADIUS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/talkincode/ToughRADIUS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/talkincode/ToughRADIUS)

TOUGHRADIUS is a Radius server software developed based on Python, which implements the standard Radius protocol and supports the extension of Radius protocol.

TOUGHRADIUS can be understood as a Radius middleware, and it does not implement all of the business functions. It needs access to the back-end business system.

TOUGHRADIUS provides complete back end interface support, such as supporting HTTP protocol access capabilities, and the back-end business system must provide additional HTTP API interfaces,
