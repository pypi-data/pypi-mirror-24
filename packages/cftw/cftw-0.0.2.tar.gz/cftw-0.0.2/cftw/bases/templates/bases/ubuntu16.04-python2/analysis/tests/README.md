## Tests Folder

This folder contains all tests that are intended to be run with the Continuous Integration. For python, that usually means unit tests. If you are a competition generator, your unit tests should be written here, and the tests should:

 - validate formats of expected output
 - assess some result with your metric(s) of interest
