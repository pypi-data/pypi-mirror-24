        ``bum`` is a daemon that downloads album art for songs playing in
        ``mpd``/``mopidy`` and displays them in a little window. ``bum`` doesn't
        loop on a timer, instead it waits for ``mpd``/``mopidy`` to send a
        ``player`` event. When it receives a ``player`` event it wakes up and
        downloads album art for the current playing track. This makes ``bum``
        lightweight and makes it idle at ``~0%`` CPU usage.
        
        ``bum`` uses `musicbrainz <https://musicbrainz.org/>`__ to source and
        download cover art, if an album is missing it's cover art you can easily
        create an account and fill in the data yourself. ``bum`` outputs a
        ``release-id`` which you can use to find the exact entry on musicbrainz.
        
        Note: ``bum`` is meant to be used with files that don't have embedded
        album art (``mopidy-spotify``).
