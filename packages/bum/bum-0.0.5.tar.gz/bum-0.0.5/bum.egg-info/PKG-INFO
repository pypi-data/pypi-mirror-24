        `bum` is a daemon that downloads album art for songs playing in `mpd` and displays them in a little window. `bum` doesn't loop on a timer, instead you can send it `SIGUSR1` to make it wake up and download album art for the current playing track. This makes `bum` lightweight and makes it idle at `~0%` CPU usage.
        
        `bum` uses [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) to source and download cover art, if an album is missing it's cover art you can easily create an account and fill in the data yourself. `bum` outputs a `release-id` which you can use to find the exact entry on musicbrainz.
        
        Note: `bum` is meant to be used with files that don't have embedded album art (`mopidy-spotify`).

        ## Customization
        
        ### ncmpcpp
        
        You can configure `ncmpcpp` to send `SIGUSR1` to `bum` on every song change.
        
        
        ```
        # .ncmpcpp/config
        
        # Execute bum on song change.
        execute_on_song_change = "pkill -USR1 bum"
        ```
        
        ### shell
        
        You can use `mpc idleloop` to send `SIGUSR1` to `bum` on every song change.
        
        
        ```sh
        #!/bin/sh
        # Wake up bum on song change.
        while :; do
            mpc idleloop player | pkill -USR1 bum$
        done
        ```
