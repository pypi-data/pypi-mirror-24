ThingFlow is a (Python3) framework for building IOT event processing
dataflows. The goal of this framework is to support the
creation of robust IoT systems from reusable components. These systems must
account for noisy/missing sensor data, distributed computation, and the
need for local (near the data source) processing.

ThingFlow is pure Python (3.4 or later). The packaged distribution
(e.g. on PyPi) only includes the core Python code. The source repository at
https://github.com/mpi-sws-rse/thingflow-python contains the core Python
code plus the documentation, examples, and tests. There is also a port
of ThingFlow for micropython available in the source repo.
