# cartesian
---

cartesian is a lightweight implementation of Cartesian genetic programming with symbolic regression in mind.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) or [glyph](https://github.com/Ambrosys/glyph).

The basic components are provided:
- data structure
- 1+4 Algorithm
- symbolic, ephemeral and structured constants
