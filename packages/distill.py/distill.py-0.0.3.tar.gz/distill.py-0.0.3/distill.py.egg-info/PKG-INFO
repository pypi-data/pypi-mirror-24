        I love blogging. In fact, I love blogging too much. I used to use wordpress, mkdocs but I don't satisfy with these platform. So I create my own platform FOR ME.
        
        Notes:
        
        * It's quick and very dirty project.
        * I'm sure that I don't known how to "finish it"
        * However I guarantee it will task some years.
        * And finally I will make fun (and many bugs)
