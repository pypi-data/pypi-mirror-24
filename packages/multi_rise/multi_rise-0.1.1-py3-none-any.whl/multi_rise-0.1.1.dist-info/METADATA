If you want to use this create an index.txt file with a sequence of
paths to your files each on a new line in the order you wish them to be
included in your final presentation.

Then use with this file in the directory.

.. code:: bash

    multi_rise --index=index.txt --output=output.ipynb

where index is the index file and output is the name of the output file.

The index file is a file that contains file paths that will be combined
into the final notebook.

-  The order in which the files appear in the index file is the order in
   which they'll be combined into the final notebook.
-  Files can appear more than once.
-  The file paths should be relative to the working directory in which
   the command is invoked.
-  The file paths should only appear one per line
-  It currently does no safe catching (e.g., of spaces) for you.

This only works on python 3.4+.
