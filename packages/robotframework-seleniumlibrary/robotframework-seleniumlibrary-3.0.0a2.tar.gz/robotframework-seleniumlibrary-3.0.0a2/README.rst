Introduction
------------

SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for `Robot Framework`_ that utilizes
the popular Selenium_ tool internally. See the `keyword documentation`_
for available keywords and `wiki`_ for some more general information
about the library.

SeleniumLibrary is based on the `old SeleniumLibrary`_ that was forked to
Selenium2Library and then later renamed back to SeleniumLibrary.

The new SeleniumLibrary is currently in pre-release phase. The final
SeleniumLibrary 3.0 release is planned for early September.

Installation
------------

The recommended installation method is using pip_::

    pip install --pre robotframework-seleniumlibrary

Notice that ``--pre`` is needed to get the current SeleniumLibrary,
not the `old SeleniumLibrary`_, until the final SeleniumLibrary 3.0
is released.

To install the old Selenium2Library, use this command instead::

    pip install robotframework-selenium2library

See `INSTALL.rst`_ for more details about installation.

Usage
-----

To write tests with Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary,
SeleniumLibrary must be imported into your Robot test suite.
See `Robot Framework User Guide`_ for more information.
