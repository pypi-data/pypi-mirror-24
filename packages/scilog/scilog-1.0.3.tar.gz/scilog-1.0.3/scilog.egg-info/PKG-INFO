        This package provides a command line tool to save information about numerical experiments along with the results.
        
        In its easiest form, :code:`scilog 'my_program {}' -e 'range(4)'`, runs `my_program` with the inputs [0,1,2,3], and stores output, runtime, and system information in the directory`scilog/my_program`. 
        (Don't worry. Running the same command again, creates subfolders `scilog/my_program/v0` and `scilog/my_program/v1`. Nothing ever gets overwritten.)
        
        If the flag `--git` is used, `scilog` additionally creates a snapshot commit of the current working tree in the git branch `_scilog` of the containing git repository.
        
        For numerical experiments using Python, one can use the simple syntax `scilog my_package.my_module.my_function` instead of
        `scilog 'python -m my_package.my_module.my_function'`. The flags `--memory_profile` and `--runtime_profile` can then be used store additional detailed runtime and memory usage information.
        
        Information on previous scilog entries can be displayed using `scilog --load 'my_program'`
        
        scilog can also be called within python, using the functions `scilog.conduct` and `scilog.load`.
