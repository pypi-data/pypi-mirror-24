MXNet Python Package
====================

`MXNet <http://mxnet.io>`__ is a deep learning framework designed for
both *efficiency* and *flexibility*. It allows you to mix the flavours
of deep learning programs together to maximize the efficiency and your
productivity.

Prerequisites
-------------

This package supports Linux platform only and includes MKLML support for
Intel CPU acceleration, and requires CUDA-8.0 for GPU acceleration. Also
