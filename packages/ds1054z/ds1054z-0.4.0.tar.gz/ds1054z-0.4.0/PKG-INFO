        ds1054z
        =======
        
        This package allows you to connect to your Rigol DS1054Z oscilloscope
        via Ethernet. It comes with a versatile command line tool.
        
        Off course, you can also use it to control the scope with your own
        script by using `the
        API <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/api/index.html>`__ this
        package has to offer.
        
        While this software is named after the entry level oscilloscope DS1054Z,
        I believe there is no reason it wouldn't work with just any scope of the
        DS1000Z and MSO1000Z series by Rigol:
        
        -  DS1054Z
        -  DS1074Z
        -  DS1104Z
        -  DS1074Z-S
        -  DS1104Z-S
        -  MSO1074Z
        -  MSO1104Z
        -  MSO1074Z-S
        -  MSO1104Z-S
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Discovering your scope via mDNS / DNS-SD
        -  Saving Screenshots (incl. adjustable dimming of on-screen controls)
        -  Running / stopping the scope
        -  Acquiring waveforms
        -  ... more to come!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The installation is dead simple:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ds1054z[savescreen,discovery]
        
        ds1054z depends on
        `python-vxi11 <https://github.com/python-ivi/python-vxi11>`__ which
        should automatically get installed along with itself.
        
        For more information on the installation, please consult the
        `installation
        section <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installation.html>`__
        of the `package
        documentation <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/index.html>`__.
        
        **Recommended Firmware**
        
        Older versions of the oscilloscope's firmware have many issues. The
        VXI-11 connection could be unstable or commands might return unexpected
        data. Specifically, I'm recommending version 00.04.04.SP3 (alias
        00.04.04.03.02) published on 2017-02-08.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Command Line Tool
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This package installs a versatile command line (CLI) tool called
        ``ds1054z``. You can use it to save the screen of your scope, for
        example:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ds1054z save-screen --overlay 0.6 192.168.0.23
        
        You can find out more ways to use the CLI tool with ``ds1054z --help``
        or by reading `the
        manual <http://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/using-the-cli.html>`__.
        
        Developers
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you're into Python programming, use `the DS1054Z
        class <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/api/ds1054z.html>`__ in
        your own code:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from ds1054z import DS1054Z
        
            scope = DS1054Z('192.168.0.23')
            print("Connected to: ", scope.idn)
        
            print("Currently displayed channels: ", str(scope.displayed_channels))

        ---------
        
        -  This Python package was inspired by
           `DS1054Z\_screen\_capture <https://github.com/RoGeorge/DS1054Z_screen_capture>`__.
        -  The device discovery built into this software is largely based on
           `this

           by `MerseyViking / GeoSpark <https://github.com/MerseyViking>`__.
        -  There is a Qt4 based GUI interface for the scope called
           `DSRemote <http://www.teuniz.net/DSRemote/>`__.
