        What is this?
        -------------
        
        This is a small library which gets all GitHub users given a city.
        Original idea is `Top-GitHub-Users-Data`_ by
        [@JJ](https://github.com/JJ), an adaptation of `top-github-users`_ from
        [@paulmillr](https://github.com/paulmillr/).
        
        What I can do with this?
        ------------------------
        
        Now, you only can get all user names from a city (with a city in the
        location field). In future, this will be an amazing library.
        
        What I need to run this?
        ------------------------
        
        You will need to install Python 3. Python 2 is not supported. I
        recommend you `install Anaconda`_.
        
        In addition, you will need to get ID and Secret from a GitHub
        application. `You can register your own application here!`_.
        
        Dependences
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        You have a ``requeriments.txt`` file. Install all dependences with
        ``pip install -r requeriments.txt``.
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Basic example
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. code:: python
        
            idGH = os.environ.get('GH_ID')
            secretGH = os.environ.get('GH_SECRET')
            configuration = {
               "excludedLocations": [],
               "excludedUsers": [],
               "intervals": [
                   [
                       "2008-01-01",
                       "2015-12-30"
                   ]
               ],
               "last_date": "2015-12-30",
               "locations": [
                   "Ceuta"
                   ],
               "name": "Ceuta"
                   }
            ciudad = GitHubCity(idGH, secretGH, configuration)
            ciudad.calculateBestIntervals()
            ciudad.addFilter("repos", ">1")
            ciudad.addFilter("followers", ">1")
            ciudad.getCityUsers()
        
        Excluding users
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        You can generate a JSON file like this (each element is an user and this
        properties are name -login name of the user- and reason -why this user
        has been banned-):
        
        .. code:: json
        
            [
              {
                "name": "asdpokjdf",
                "reason": "It is only a test"
              },
              {
                "name": "asdfasdf",
                "reason": "It is only a test"
              },
              {
                "name": "asdfasdfadf",
                "reason": "It is only a test"
              }
            ]
