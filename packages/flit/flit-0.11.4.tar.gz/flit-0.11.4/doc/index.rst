Environment variables
---------------------

.. envvar:: FLIT_USERNAME
            FLIT_PASSWORD
            FLIT_INDEX_URL

   .. versionadded:: 0.11

   Use these to set the username, password and URL for package uploads, such as
   when uploading from a CI server. For interactive use, it's normally more
   convenient to use ``.pypirc``.

.. envvar:: FLIT_NO_NETWORK

   .. versionadded:: 0.10

   Setting this to any non-empty value will stop flit from making network
   connections (unless you explicitly ask to upload or register a package). This
   is intended for downstream packagers, so if you use this, it's up to you to
   ensure any necessary dependencies are installed.

.. envvar:: FLIT_ROOT_INSTALL

   By default, ``flit install`` will fail when run as root on POSIX systems,
   because installing Python modules systemwide is not recommended. Setting
   this to any non-empty value allows installation as root. It has no effect on
   Windows.

.. envvar:: SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH

   To make reproducible builds, set this to a timestamp as a number of seconds
   since the start of the year 1970 in UTC. See `the specification
   <https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/>`__ for more
   details.
