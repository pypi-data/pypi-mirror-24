How to install
--------------
 
Easy option: install with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply run::

   pip install -U tensorly

That's it!

Alternatively, you can pip install from the git repository::

   pip install git+https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly

Development: install from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library is still very new and under heavy developement. To install the last version:

Clone the repository and cd there::

   git clone https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly
   cd tensorly

Then install the package (here in editable mode with `-e` or equivalently `--editable`)::

   pip install -e .

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing and documentation are an essential part of this package and all functions come with uni-tests and documentation.

You can run all the tests using the `nose` package::

   nosetests -v tensorly
