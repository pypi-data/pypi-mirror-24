Description: 
        Installation
        ============
        
        pip install echo_api
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Secrets
        =======
        
        ``echo_api`` is configured to take credentials from a file named
        ``secrets.json`` that is expected by default in your working directory.
        ``secrets.json`` should look like:
        
        {
            "USERNAME": "Username",
            "PASSWORD": "P4ssw0rd123",
            "WSDL_LOCATION": "wsdl.xml",
            "ENDPOINT": "https://cloud.echooneappcloud.com/yourorganization/OneAppWebService"
        }
        
        If you want ``secrets.json`` to be somewhere other than your project
        directory, you will need to set it in a ``Settings`` object and make
        reference to it in your ``Connection``. More on that below.
        
        Note that you must have credentials for a user that has access to the
        API before you can proceed.
        
        API Definition
        ==============
        
        Due to the possibility of some configuration issues on Echo's side, you
        will need to manually inspect the XML describing the API and ensure that
        the endpoint definition is correct. Copy and paste this into the address
        bar on your browser (you will need to change it to be your
        organization):
        
        https://cloud.echooneappcloud.com/yourorganization/OneAppWebService.svc?singleWsdl
        
        Copy and paste the XML response into an XML file (``wsdl.xml``) in your
        project directory and scroll all the way to the bottom until you see:
        
        <wsdl:port name="BasicHttpBinding_OneAppWebService_SSL" binding="tns:BasicHttpBinding_OneAppWebService_SSL">
            <soap:address location="https://eoaapp0.echooneapp.com/YourOrganization/OneAppWebService.svc"/>
            </wsdl:port>
        </wsdl:service>
        
        You will want to change
        
        <soap:address location="https://eoaapp0.echooneapp.com/YourOrganization/OneAppWebService.svc"/>
        
        to
        
        <soap:address location="https://cloud.echooneappcloud.com/yourorganization/OneAppWebService"/>
        
        Once you've set up your wsdl and secrets files, test your connection.
        For a secrets file that will remain in your project directory, simply
        use:
        
        .. code:: ipython3
        
            from echo_api import Connection
            # Connection() will log you in if everything is correctly configured.
            connection = Connection()
            connection.session_id
        
        
        
        
        .. parsed-literal::
        
            'IAMYOURSESSIONID'
        
        
        
        If you wish to use a custom secrets location, you will need to create a
        ``Settings`` object and use that when creating your connection.
        
        .. code:: ipython3
        
            from echo_api import Settings, Connection
            # secrets_location is full or relative path to secrets location
            settings = Settings(secrets_location='secrets.json')
            connection = Connection(settings=settings)
