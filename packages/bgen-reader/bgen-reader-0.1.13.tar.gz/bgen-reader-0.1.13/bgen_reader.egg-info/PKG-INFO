Description: Bgen-reader
        ===========
        
        |Travis|
        
        A `BGEN file format <http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/>`__
        reader.
        
        BGEN is a file format for storing large genetic datasets. It supports
        both unphased genotypes and phased haplotype data with variable ploidy
        and number of alleles. It was designed to provides a compact data
        representation without sacrificing variant access performance.
        
        This Python package is a wrapper around the `bgen
        library <https://github.com/limix/bgen>`__, a low-memory footprint
        reader that efficiently reads BGEN files. It fully supports all the BGEN
        format specifications: 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3; as well as their optional
        compressed formats.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        The recommended way of installing it is via
        `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html>`__
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            conda install -c conda-forge bgen-reader
        
        An alternative way would be via pip
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install bgen-reader
        
        In this case, you need to make sure you have both
        `Zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd>`__ and
        `bgen <https://github.com/limix/bgen>`__ libraries properly installed.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        It is as simple as
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # example.py file
            from bgen_reader import read_bgen
        
            bgen = read_bgen("example.bgen", verbose=False)
        
            print(bgen['variants'].head())
            print(bgen['samples'].head())
            print(len(bgen['genotype']))
            print(bgen['genotype'][0].compute())
        
        The output should something similar to
        
        ::
        
            chrom       id  nalleles   pos    rsid
            0    01  SNPID_2         2  2000  RSID_2

            2    01  SNPID_4         2  4000  RSID_4
            3    01  SNPID_5         2  5000  RSID_5
            4    01  SNPID_6         2  6000  RSID_6

            2  sample_003
            3  sample_004
            4  sample_005
