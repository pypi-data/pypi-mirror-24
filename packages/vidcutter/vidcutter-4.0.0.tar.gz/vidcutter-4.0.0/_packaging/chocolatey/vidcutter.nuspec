    <description>
    The simplest &amp; sexiest tool for cutting and joining your videos without needing to re-encode.
    
    VidCutter focuses on just getting the job done using the best options determined from your source media. Did we mention it was super fast too? :-)

    mpv powered playback for frame-level accuracy and support for the widest array of media file formats and codec/filter configurations, it should work with any source media you throw at it as long as its valid. It should even accept moderately corrupted media too, re-indexing and salvaging what it can if the metadata exists. Direct-stream cutting and joining is then performed with the help of the legendary FFmpeg library. No reencoding ever, even blue-ray sized files cut into scenes, rearranged in the index and joined together in under 10 seconds in most cases.

    Technical Note: Installation is in C:\Program Files\VidCutter via Chocolatey for both the 32 and 64 bit versions.
