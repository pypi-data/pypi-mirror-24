Description: dictionary style caches
        =======================
        
        Faste is a cache library to allow many different cache algorithms in Python, with the functionality of a regular dict.
        Anything you can do to a dict, you can do to these caches.
        
        ``$ pip install faste``
        
        All The Caches(tm)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Every cache has the signature ``CacheNameHere(max_items)``
        
        max_items is the max length of the cache before items start getting evicted.
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import faste
        
            # Random Replacement
            # When cache is full, random items are removed to make space for new ones
            RR = faste.RRCache(max_items)
        
            # First In First Out
            # When cache is full, cache evicts the last key that was set
            FIFO = faste.FIFOCache(max_items)
        
            # Least Recently Used
            # When cache is full, least recently accessed item is evicted
            LRU = faste.LRUCache(max_items)
        
            # Most Recently Used
            # When cache is full, most recently accessed item is evicted
            # Useful for caches where old data is more commonly accessed
            MRU = faste.MRUCache(max_items)
        
            # Least Frequently Used
            # When cache is full, least frequently accessed item is evicted
            LFU = faste.LFUCache(max_items)
