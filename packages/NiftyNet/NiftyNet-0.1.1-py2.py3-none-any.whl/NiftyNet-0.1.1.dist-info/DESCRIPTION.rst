NiftyNet
========

NiftyNet is a `TensorFlow`_-based [#]_ open-source convolutional neural networks (CNN) platform for research in medical image analysis and image-guided therapy.
NiftyNet's modular structure is designed for sharing networks and pre-trained models.
Using this modular structure you can:

* Get started with established pre-trained networks using built-in tools
* Adapt existing networks to your imaging data
* Quickly build new solutions to your own image analysis problems

NiftyNet is a consortium of research groups (WEISS -- `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences`_, CMIC -- `Centre for Medical Image Computing`_, HIG -- High-dimensional Imaging Group), where WEISS acts as the consortium lead.

.. [#] Please install the appropriate `TensorFlow`_ PyPI package (``tensorflow`` or ``tensorflow-gpu``) **before** executing ``pip install niftynet`` -- see the instructions on the `NiftyNet source code repository`_ for details.


Features
========

NiftyNet currently supports medical image segmentation and generative adversarial networks.
**NiftyNet is not intended for clinical use**.
Other features of NiftyNet include:

* Easy-to-customise interfaces of network components
* Sharing networks and pretrained models
* Support for 2-D, 2.5-D, 3-D, 4-D inputs [#]_
* Efficient discriminative training with multiple-GPU support
* Implementation of recent networks (HighRes3DNet, 3D U-net, V-net, DeepMedic)
* Comprehensive evaluation metrics for medical image segmentation

.. [#] 2.5-D: volumetric images processed as a stack of 2D slices; 4-D: co-registered multi-modal 3D volumes
