0.0.11
- better error handling of binning methods that fail to run to completion

0.0.10
- better error handling for directories missing any valid bins

0.0.9
- added the 'bin' command

0.0.8
- simplified reporting by having a single parameter for setting 
  the weight used for calculating quality

0.0.7
- changed 'consensus' binning so a contig is only removed 
  iff it appears in a consensus of non-matched bins, which
  not includes the highest quality bin as a positive hit
- percentage to remove a contig must also now be strictly
  greater than the specified percentage
- also made changes to the 'consensus' method for adding contigs
- took out merging of bins since it was producing chimeric bins on the CAMI synthetic community
- change default weighting for quality from 5 to 2

0.0.6
- fixed bug with 'greedy' method

0.0.5
- refined 'majority vote' method and renamed to 'consensus'
- 'greedy' method now performed as special case of 'consensus' method to simplify code base
- added option to merge partial bins

0.0.4
- initial implementation of greedy 'majority vote' method

0.0.3
- initial implementation of Markov 'majority vote' method

0.0.2
- initial implementation of greedy method

0.0.1
