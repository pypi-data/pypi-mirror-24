Description: Presents:
        
        * return_exc_info: call supplied function with arguments, return either (function_result, None) or (None, exc_info) if an exception was raised.
        
        * @returns_exc_info, a decorator for a function which wraps in it return_exc_info.
        
        * @noexc, a decorator for a function whose exceptions should never escape; instead they are logged. The initial use case was inside logging functions, where I have had a failed logging action abort a program. Obviously this is a decorator which should see very little use.
        
        * @noexc_gen, a decorator for generators with similar effect to @noexc for ordinary functions.
        
        * NoExceptions, a context manager to intercept most exceptions
        
        * LogExceptions, a context manager to log exceptions
        
        * @logexc, a decorator to make a function log exceptions it raises
        
        * @transmute, a decorator to transmute an inner exception to another exception type
        
        * @unattributable, a decorator to transmute inner AttributeError into a RuntimeError
        
        * @unimplemented, a decorator to make a method raise NotImplementedError
