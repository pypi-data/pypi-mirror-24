Celery distributed task queue module for Invenio.

Invenio-Celery is a small discovery layer that takes care of discovering and
loading tasks from other Invenio modules, as well as providing configuration
defaults for Celery usage in Invenio. Invenio-Celery relies on Flask-CeleryExt
for integrating Flask and Celery with application factories.

Further documentation is available on https://invenio-celery.readthedocs.io/
