        The add on ``collective.easyform`` adds Plone content types for form creation.
        
        EasyForm provides a Plone form builder through-the-web using fields, widgets, actions and validators (based on `Dexterity <https://github.com/plone/plone.dexterity>`_).
        
        Form input can be saved or emailed.
        A simple and user-friendly interface allows non-programmers to create custom forms.
        
        **Note:** This Plone package is similar to `Archetypes <http://docs.plone.org/develop/plone/content/archetypes/>`_ based `Products.PloneFormGen <https://github.com/smcmahon/Products.PloneFormGen>`_ for Plone versions 1 to 4.
        
        Dexterity is the default framework for building content types in Plone 5.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install collective.easyform by adding it to your buildout:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
        	[buildout]
        
        	...
        
        	eggs =
        		collective.easyform
        
        
        Run buildout:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
        	bin/buildout
        
        The last step is to activate ``EasyForm`` in the Control Panel.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        - Choose EasyForm from the toolbars 'Add new' menu.
          Insert form title, description and other settings.
        - Add fields or fieldsets to create a unique form that will meet your particular requirements.
          There are enough basic field types to satisfy any demands:
        
          - File Upload,
          - Text line (String),
          - Integer,
          - Yes/No,

          - Multiple Choice,
          - Text,
          - Password,
          - Re–°aptcha.
        
        - Continue to customize form by setting the order of fields,
          defining required and hidden ones,
          choosing validator, if necessary,
          and other field type specific settings.
