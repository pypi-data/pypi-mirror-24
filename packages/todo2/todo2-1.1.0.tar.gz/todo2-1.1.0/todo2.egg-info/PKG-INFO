        ========
        ###### Simple TODO list generator
        
        ### Why
        Because i couldn't find any other tool to do (pun unintended) this. Also i
        found it annoying to `Ctrl+F` (`Cmd+F`) all the time or run project wide
        searches every 2 minutes.
        
        ### How
        Well, code is a bit dirty and the ignore list is hardcoded, but it is
        OpenSource so be my guest and improve it (Could use some regex). The script
        cheks for an existing `.git` directory, finds the user and repo (this way it 
        creates links to the GitHub file and line) and then searches for the `# TODO`
        tag in all source files. Feel free to change it to `// TODO` and `.c`.
        
        ### Install
        Option 0:
        ```
        pip install todo2
        ```
        
        Option 1:
        ```
        git clone git@github.com:thee-engineer/todo.git
        cd todo
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ### Use
        Go into your git project folder, run the `todo` command, and then look at your
        awesome `TODO.md` file. Add it, commit it, push it, look at it, click on it.
        ```
        cd my_git_project
        todo
        git add TODO.md
        git commit -m "Add TODO.md"
        git push
        ```
        
        
        ### Contribution
        Add whatever. Right know the project could use (but I don't want to invest
        the time):
        - [ ] Regex matches for gitignore rules
        - [ ] CL Arguments (this way more feature can be implemented)
        - [ ] Option for non-git projects
        - [ ] Branch checking
        - [ ] Local file links
        - [ ] TODO completion check and comment removal
