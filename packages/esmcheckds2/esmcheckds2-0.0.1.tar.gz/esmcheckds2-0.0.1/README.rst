McAfee SIEM Check Datasources: esm-ds-check-2
================================

This script queries a McAfee ESM for inactive data sources.

**Updates from esm-check-ds v1:**

 - Hundeds of times faster - completely rewritten to perform mininum number of queries 
 instead of querying for every datasource.
   
 - McAfee ESM 9.x and 10.x versions are now supported in a single script.

 - Additional information provided for each datasource (IP, Receiver name)
 
 - Output changed to CSV for easy manipulation. 
 
 - Compiled into an executable for easy use on Windows.
 
 - Centralized ini file to home directory instead of script directory for increased security.
  

This is written in Python 3; directions on how to create a virtual environment
to run the script on both Linux and Windows are available at: 
https://community.mcafee.com/people/andy777/blog/2016/11/29/installing-python-3

The script requires a mfe_saw.ini file for the credentials. See installation notes
to determine which directory it should be placed for your operating system.

Usage
------------


```
    Usage: esm-check_ds (days|hours|minutes)=x  
```
    
**Examples:**
   
        esm-check_ds days=2
        esm-check_ds hours=6
        esm-check_ds minutes=60
    
**Output is csv:**
```
    name,ip,model,rec_name,last_time
```    
Redirect output to file and import as a spreadsheet.

Output Sample:

    $ python esm-check-ds-2.py

Prerequisites
-------------------
* Python 3 if running as script
* Windows platform if running as exe
* McAfee ESM running version 9.x or 10.x
* Port 443 access to the ESM
* NGCP credentials

Installation
------------
To install esm-check-ds-2, you can download the script or exe from this site or install via PIP.

[Windows EXE Package](https://github.com/andywalden/esm-check-ds-2)

[Python project and source code](https://github.com/andywalden/esm-check-ds-2)

Or install via PIP:

    $ pip install esm-check-ds-2

Configuration
------------
This script requires a '.mfe_saw.ini' file in your home directory. This file contains sensitive clear text credentials for the McAfee ESM so it is important it be protected. This is same ini file will be referenced by all future ESM related projects also.

It looks like this:
```
[esm]
esmhost=10.0.0.1
esmuser=NGCP
esmpass=SuppaSecret
```
An example mfe-saw.ini is available in the download or at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andywalden/esm-check-ds-2/mfe_saw.ini

**Windows**
Go to Start | Run and type %APPDATA% into the box and press enter. This will open your
Windows home directory. Edit the Copy the customized .mfe_saw.ini (period in front) to the directory.

**Linux/*nix**

The '.mfe_saw.ini' file will either live in: \$HOME or: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. You can determine which by
typing:
```
echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
echo $HOME

```
One or both should list your home directory. If both options are available, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the more modern and recommended choice.
