Python Library for integrating with GloBee
-------------------------------------

This library is a simple way to integrate your application with
GloBee for accepting bitcoin & altcoin payments. It exposes three basic
functions, authenticating with globee, creating invoices,
and retrieving invoices. It is not meant as a replacement for 
the entire GloBee API. However, the key_utils module contains
all of the tools you need to use the BitPay API for other
purposes.

This version requires Python 3 or later; a Python 2 version is available separately.
