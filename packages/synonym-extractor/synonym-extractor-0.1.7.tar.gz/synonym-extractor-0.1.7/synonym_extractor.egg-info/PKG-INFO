        synonym-extractor
        =================
        
        Synonym Extractor is a python library that is loosely based on `Aho-Corasick algorithm
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm>`_.
        
        The idea is to extract words that we care about from a given sentence in one pass.
        
        Basically say I have a vocabulary of 10K words and I want to get all the words from that set present in a sentence. A simple regex match will take a lot of time to loop over the 10K documents.
        
        Hence we use a simpler yet much faster algorithm to get the desired result.
        
        Installation
        -------
        ::
        
            pip install synonym-extractor
        
        Usage
        ------
        ::
            
            # import module
            from synonym.extractor import SynonymExtractor
        
            # Create an object of SynonymExtractor
            synonym_extractor = SynonymExtractor()
        
            # add synonyms
            synonym_names = ['NY', 'new-york', 'SF']
            clean_names = ['new york', 'new york', 'san francisco']
        
            for synonym_name, clean_name in zip(synonym_names, clean_names):
                synonym_extractor.add_to_synonym(synonym_name, clean_name)
        
            synonyms_found = synonym_extractor.get_synonyms_from_sentence('I love SF and NY. new-york is the best.')
        
            synonyms_found
            >> ['san francisco', 'new york', 'new york']
        
        
        Algorithm
        ----------
        
        synonym-extractor is based on `Aho-Corasick algorithm
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm>`_.
        
        Documentation
        ----------
        
        Documentation can be found at `Read the Docs
        <http://synonym-extractor.readthedocs.org>`_.
        
        
        Why
        ------
        
        ::
        
        Say you have a corpus where similar words appear frequently.
        
        eg: Last weekened I was in NY.
            I am traveling to new york next weekend.
        
        If you train a word2vec model on this or do any sort of NLP it will treat NY and new york as 2 different words. 
        
        Instead if you create a synonym dictionary like:
        
        eg: NY=>new york
            new york=>new york
        
        Then you can extract NY and new york as the same text.
        
        To do the same with regex it will take a lot of time:
        
        ============  ========== = =========  ============
        Docs count    # Synonyms : Regex      synonym-extractor
        ============  ========== = =========  ============
        1.5 million   2K         : 16 hours   NA
        2.5 million   10K        : 15 days    15 mins
        ============  ========== = =========  ============
        
        The idea for this library came from the following `StackOverflow question
        <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44178449/regex-replace-is-taking-time-for-millions-of-documents-how-to-make-it-faster>`_.
