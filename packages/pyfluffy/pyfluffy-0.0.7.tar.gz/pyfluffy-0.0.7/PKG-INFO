Description: # Fluffy - A Firewall as a Service
        
        Fluffy is a firewall as a service solution that primarily targets Linux environments.
        
        ## Features
        
        * A fully documented RESTful API using Flasgger
        * Session based configuration so that changes can be tested and committed atomically without affecting the active configuration
        * Rollback methods using unattended server-side checks including rollback intervals with a *commit/confirm* type of functionality
        * Source and destination addresses are managed by a global *addressbook* which also supports inheritance
        * Source and destination services are managed by a global *services catalog*
        * Chains support including default policy, packet matching tables etc.
        * Interfaces support
        
        ## Puppet integration
        
        A module is available on [PuppetForge](https://forge.puppet.com/m4ce/fluffy).
        
        ## Running in Docker
        
        ```
        $ docker pull m4ce/fluffy
        ```
        
        The container needs to run in privileged mode (--privileged). Additionally, you will need to make sure the Docker daemon is started with `--iptables=false`.
        
        ## Todo
        
        * API docs
        * Integration tests
        * API-key based authentication
