Description: # Fluffy - A Firewall as a Service
        
        Fluffy is a firewall as a service solution that primarily targets Linux environments.
        
        ## Features
        
        * A fully documented RESTful API using Flasgger
        * Session based configuration so that changes can be tested and committed atomically without affecting the active configuration
        * Rollback methods using unattended server-side checks including rollback intervals with a *commit/confirm* type of functionality
        * Source and destination addresses are managed by a global *addressbook* which also supports inheritance
        * Source and destination services are managed by a global *services catalog*
        * Chains support including default policy, packet matching tables etc.
        * Interfaces support
        
        ## Puppet integration
