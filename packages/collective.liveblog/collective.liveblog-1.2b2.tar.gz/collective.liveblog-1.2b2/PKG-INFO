        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ==================================
        
        A liveblog is a blog post which is intended to provide a rolling textual coverage of an ongoing event.
        
        A liveblog is continuously updated with timestamped micro-updates which are placed above previous micro-updates.
        
        Typical use case is the following:
        
        - The publisher of a news site creates a liveblog
        - Editors add micro-updates to the liveblog as the event goes on
        - Visitors of the site on the liveblog get micro-updates automatically via AJAX calls
        
        Who is using it?
        ----------------
        
        These are some of the sites using ``collective.liveblog``:
        
        - `CartaCapital <http://www.cartacapital.com.br/>`_ (BR)
        - `Portal Brasil 2016 <http://www.brasil2016.gov.br/>`_ (BR)
        
        Mostly Harmless

        Don't Panic
        ===========
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.liveblog
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.liveblog`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installing the package you will see a new content type available: Liveblog.
        
        Liveblogs have title, description, image and text fields.
        The image field is used to set up a header on the liveblog.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/create-liveblog.png
            :align: center
            :height: 440px
            :width: 640px
        
        Now, go to the Update tab and start writing micro-updates.
        
        A micro-update is basically a text that should optionally have a title.
        The date and time of the micro-update is automatically recorded for you.
        After publishing a micro-update you will see it on top of your liveblog before all previous micro-updates.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/create-microupdate.png
            :align: center
            :height: 580px
            :width: 640px
        
        All people viewing your liveblog will receive automatic updates every minute.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/anonymous-view.png
            :align: center
            :height: 560px
            :width: 640px
        
        Micro-updates can be viewed as separate pieces of content,
        using the link in their timestamp,
        making easy to share them in social networks.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/microupdate.png
            :align: center
            :height: 480px
            :width: 640px
        
        Many editors can update the liveblog safely.
        When another editor adds a micro-update you will see it automatically on your screen even if you are writing a new one.
        
        You can delete micro-updates also.
        This will trigger a complete page refresh on all current viewers to avoid the displaying of invalid content in your liveblog.
        The page refresh will happen withing the next minute.
        If another editor deletes a micro-update you will see a message on your screen but no content refresh will take place.
        This way we avoid interrupting editors from their work.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.github.com/collective/collective.liveblog/master/remote-delete.png
            :align: center
            :height: 500px
            :width: 640px
        
        Automatic updates in liveblogs are turned off if there have been no new micro-updates in the last 24 hours.
        
        How does it work
        ----------------
        
        TBD.

        Changelog
        =========

        ------------------
        
        - Avoid ``AttributeError`` on transform chain caused by invalid output on ``recent-updates`` view when there are no new micro-updates available (refs. `plone.protect#64 <https://github.com/plone/plone.protect/issues/64>`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        
        1.2b1 (2016-06-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Liveblogs are now added to the list of linkable objects in TinyMCE at installation time.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix URL of AJAX call to get latest updates of a Liveblog (fixes `#32`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Liveblogs use now standard `simple_publication_workflow`;
          automatic updates in liveblogs are now turned off if there have been no new micro-updates in the last 24 hours;
          `liveblog_workflow` was removed (closes `#31`_).
          [rodfersou]
        
        - Use absolute paths to link to micro-updates.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.1b2 (2016-05-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Micro-updates are now traversable;
          this allows to share them as separate pieces of content (closes `#19`_).
          [rodfersou, hvelarde]
        
        - Use POST as request method on form used to edit micro-updates.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - A new text field to describe the Liveblog was added.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove dependency on five.grok (closes `#5`_).

          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.1b1 (2016-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Update view now uses batch pagination every 20 micro-updates to reduce load time for users with Editor role (closes `#10`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Depend on plone.batching; this drops support for Plone 4.2.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Use POST as request method on form used to add micro-updates.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove referenceable extra; Archetypes is no longer the default framework in Plone 5.
          Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add plone.app.referenceablebehavior to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - The dates of micro-updates older than today were not shown in liveblogs on **private** and **inactive** states (fixes `#14`_).

        1.0b3 (2014-09-20)
        ------------------

          [agnogueira]
        
        - Bylines on micro-updates now honor security settings and will be displayed to anonymous users only if they are allowed to see this information (closes `#6`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Editors can now edit micro-updates; a full refresh of the view will be scheduled after editing a micro-update to avoid displaying invalid content (closes `#3`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.0b2 (2014-09-13)
        ------------------
        
        - An adapter listing the URLs to be purged when a Liveblog is modified was added.
          [ericof]
        
        - Refactor ``recent-updates`` view to get rid of the timestamp parameter.
          This way we avoid a potential source of DoS attacks.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.0b1 (2014-09-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Timestamp handling was simplified.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Implement the ``Expires`` header on ``recent-updates`` view.
          This will help us control better how long the page is going to live.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Add a workflow specific to liveblogs.
          The workflow defines 3 states: private, active and inactive.
          This way we can control when automatic refresh of micro-updates happens.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Refresh the whole view when a micro-update has been deleted to avoid displaying invalid content.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - The header viewlet was including the ``html`` and ``body`` tags on rendering.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Lack of ``id`` attribute on field ``text`` was preventing TinyMCE editor from loading on Plone 4.2.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fire ``ObjectModifiedEvent`` event on micro-updates deletion to invalidate caching on views.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Implement handling of ``If-Modified-Since`` request header on ``recent-updates`` view.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Markup of time tag used on automatic updates was fixed.
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.0a1 (2014-09-01)
        ------------------
