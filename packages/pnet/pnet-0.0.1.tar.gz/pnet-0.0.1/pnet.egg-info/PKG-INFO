        ====
        
        A fast and simple packet creation and parsing lib for Python, currently nothing
        more then a proof of concept. Inspired by both the python `pypacker
        <https://github.com/mike01/pypacker>`_ library and Rust's `pnet
        <https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet>`_,
        
        ------
        Design
        ------
        
        Built around trying to minimize copying data by taking advantage of
        `memoryviews <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memory-views>`_
        for fast slicing and zero copy memory operations. 
        
        This library takes either a `bytes` or `bytearray` object and parses out
        various protocols in a similar fashion to the Rust library. The resulting
        packet objects can be inspected, or, in the case its backed by a `bytearray`,
        also written to. In this case, the backing memory is immediately updated.
        
        Instead of mapping packet fields to attributes, I expose them instead with a
        collection-like API. This is my personal taste, as I don't like how
        autogenerated attributes end up with akward names that can overlap with Python
        keywords.
        
        -----------
        Performance
        -----------
        
        Initial testing on my machine has shown that this library is about **twice** as
        fast at parsing packets, but I haven't determined yet if this can be attributed
        to design differences, or if I'm just simply doing less.
        
        ----
        TODO
        ----
        
        This is one part of a slew of network inspecting code I'm releasing.
        
        - rich BPF support and mini-language
        - asyncio support for raw sockets and packet capturing
        - asyncio based dhcp server and client library
