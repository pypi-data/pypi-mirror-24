Overview
--------

PhishMe Intelligence and Carbon Black partner to alert your Cyber Security Team when network communication is detected
between your endpoints and botnet infrastructures. PhishMe Intelligence provides a high-signal, context-rich source of
threat intelligence about the latest phishing and malware attacks hitting businesses, universities, and agencies every
day. PhishMe analyzes and verifies every threat before we publish the indicators so your team doesnâ€™t waste time on false positives.
