     - A domain name indicator of compromise. Note: This category contains both second-level domains and fully qualified
       domains (FQDN). Where applicable, our analysts add an entry for both the FQDN and the second-level domain name.
       In some cases, the second-level domain may receive a lesser Impact Rating.
   * - Watchlist IPv4
     - An IPv4 address indicator of compromise.
   * - Watchlist URL
     - An URL indicator of compromise.
