Overview
--------

This Anomali ThreatStream integration with PhishMe Intelligence maps PhishMe Intelligence into the ThreatStream
platform.  PhishMe Intelligence provides accurate and timely alerts so that you can be ready to take fast action when
under attack. PhishMe Analysts and Researchers work to analyze and verify phishing threats delivering ransomware, key
loggers, RATs, and other types of crimeware. This high-fidelity data is delivered in multiple forms to effectively
prepare and respond to attacks.

The PhishMe Intelligence integration for Anomali Threatstream supports the ingesting of PhishMe Intelligence into
ThreatStream as a collection of Observables iTypes. Tags are used to associate Observables and preserve as much context
as possible. These Observables can then be searched and integrated into a companyâ€™s existing investigations and exported
to other tools for further usage.
