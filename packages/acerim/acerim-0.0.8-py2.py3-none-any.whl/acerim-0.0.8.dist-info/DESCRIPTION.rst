ACERIM
======

Overview
--------

Welcome to ACERIM!

Please note: this package is still in pre-alpha and is actively under development. You can direct any questions to Christian at cj.taiudovicic@gmail.com. 

The Automated Crater Ejecta Region of Interest Mapper (ACERIM) is a python package for planetary scientists that simplifies crater data analysis. If you have image data and a list of crater locations, ACERIM will help you extract data from those locations and analyze that data with statistics of your choosing.

Use ACERIM if you want to do one or more of the following::

  - import crater databases and image datasets into easily queried python objects;
  - extract image data from regions around craters given their latitude, longitude, radius, and the desired ROI window size;
  - mask your data arays to isolate pixels within the crater, on the ejecta blanket, or within a user-provided shapefile;
  - compute statistics on the extracted crater/ejecta data;
  - save and plot your ROIs and statistics.

New users can head to acerim/sample/tutorial.py for a step-by-step walkthrough (with sample data) of how to use ACERIM in a research workflow.

Note: This package was written with the Moon in mind, but is applicable to any cratered planetary body. However, ACERIM currently only supports image data in the simple cylindrical projection. For assistance reprojecting images in python, see `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`_.


Dependencies
------------

ACERIM is compatible with python versions 2.7-3.3. Additionally, the following packages are required for ACERIM to run::

  - gdal
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib


Installation
------------

**PLEASE NOTE**: Acerim depends on the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) python package. Since GDAL in turn depends on C++, it is highly recommended that you follow the installation instructions for gdal on PyPI `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL>`_. Once GDAL is successfully isntalled, proceed with installing ACERIM.


Using Anaconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recommended way to install ACERIM is using the `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/Anaconda-Overview>`_ platform which can be downloaded from `Continuum Analytics <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.  Anaconda is preferred because it

1) automatically solves package dependency conflicts, and 
2) conveniently manages your virtual environments, allowing you to separate packages with finicky dependencies from your main python installation. 

The following section will describe how to create and activate a conda virtual environment to run ACERIM. For more on Anaconda virtual environments, see `Managing Environments <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs>`_. 

With *anaconda and gdal installed*, open a terminal/command line window and create a new conda environment using:: 

  conda create --name env_name python=3.3 gdal numpy scipy pandas matplotlib

Replace env_name with your desired environment name. Listing gdal and the other dependencies outright forces conda to resolve dependency conflicts while building the environment and can avoid dependency headaches down the line. Note that the python version in your environment must be between 2.7 to 3.3 for gdal to function. You can activate the environment with::

  source activate env_name

With the environment active, install ACERIM from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the pip command::

  pip install acerim

If the installer completes without any errors, a simple import statement can verify that ACERIM was successfully installed::

  python -c "import acerim"

Now that you have ACERIM installed, head over to /acerim/sample/tutorial.py to get started with your crater analytics!


Manual installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First ensure that GDAL and the other ACERIM Dependencies_ are installed. You will also require setuptools to install the package

Download the most recent distribution of `acerim <https://pypi.python.org/simple/acerim>`_ from PyPI and unzip it in the desired directory. From the root project directory run:

::

  python setup.py install


Organization

      |- setup.py
      |- setup.cfg
      |- LICENSE.txt

The core of this project is located in /acerim. To get started using ACERIM, see tutorial.py in /acerim/sample. API documentation is listed in /docs and is also available at `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/projects/acerim/>`_. A suite of unittests is located in /acerim/tests.


Testing ACERIM
--------------

A suite of unittests are located in the /acerim/tests. They use the sample data included in /acerim/sample to test all ACERIM classes and functions. To test if ACERIM is working as it should on your machine, install the pytest module (using *conda install pytest* or *pip install pytest*) and follow the following steps::

  1) open a shell/cmd window
  2) navigate to the parent ACERIM directory (e.g.'/Users/cjtu/Desktop/acerim')
  3) run the following command:

::

    py.test acerim

A summary of test results will appear in the shell. 


Support and Bug Reporting
-------------------------

Any bugs or errors can be reported to Christian at cj.taiudovicic@gmail.com. Please include your operating system and details of your python environment (e.g. using conda list).
