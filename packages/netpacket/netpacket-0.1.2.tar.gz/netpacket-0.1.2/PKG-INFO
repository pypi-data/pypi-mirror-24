Description: netpacket, a Python module written in CPython
        =============================================
        
        |Build Status|
        
        netpacket is a packet-creator module that supports ethernet, ARP, IPv4,
        IPv6, ICMPv4, TCP, UDP and DHCPv4. It also contains a packet-capturer
        called ppcap (Python pcap). The project contains the raw CPython
        bindings, and a wrapper library written in Python, which can be found in
        the directory "netpacket".
        
        The module tries to be as user-friendly as it can be, leaving tasks like
        big-endian and little-endian fields to the module itself, the programmer
        only has to fill in the fields without concerning himself about it.
        
        Note concerning IPv4 and IPv6
        =============================
        
        IPv4 and IPv6 is the same class, but the programmer will be jailed into
        IPv4 or IPv6 usage based on an argument passed to the IP class or
        protocol classes above. IPv4: 0x0800, IPv6: 0x86dd. IPv4 is already
        default, and no argument needs to be passed.
        
        Example:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            obj = _netpacket.udp()
            print(obj)
            obj = _netpacket.udp(0x86dd)
            print(obj)
        
        <\_netpacket.udpv4 object at 0x7fbff03e3510> <\_netpacket.udpv6 object
        at 0x7fbff03e3570>
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            # Install libpcap dependency (using gentoo@portage-tree)
            emerge --ask net-libs/libpcap --quiet-build
            # Install libpcap dependency (using archlinux)
            pacman --sync core/libpcap
            # Build
            python setup.py build
            # Build and install
            python setup.py install
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        All examples can be found in the directory "examples". Docstrings is
        also available for very protocol class and the ppcap class.
        
        Platforms supported
        ===================
        
        netpacket for now only supports Linux, but will support the Unix
        variants and Mac OS X once the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) device
        implementation is coded in.
        
        Python versions supported
        =========================
        
        netpacket only supports Python3, and will never have any support for
        Python2.
        
        Things that will be present in later stages
        ===========================================
        
        -  IPv4 options.
        -  IPv6 options.
        -  TCP options.
        -  Application-layer classes:
        
           -  DNS.
           -  HTTP.
