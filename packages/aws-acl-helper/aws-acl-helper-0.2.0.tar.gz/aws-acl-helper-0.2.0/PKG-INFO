Description: AWS ACL Helper
        ==============
        
        This module implements the Squid External ACL Helper interface, and
        allows for use of EC2 instance metadata in ACL entries. It uses the
        client's source address (either public or private) as a key to determine
        which instance initiated a request through the proxy, and allows use of
        instance metadata (such as Instance ID, VPC, or Security Group
        membership) as a rule target.
        
        If the request can be mapped to an EC2 instance, the module will
        populate the EC2 Instance ID into the request's 'user' field, for
        consumption by additional ACLs or output to logs. This occurs regardless
        of whether or not the ACL matched.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        This module requires Python 3.4 or better, due to its use of the
        ``asyncio`` framework (``aioredis``, etc)
        
        This module requires a Redis server to cache AWS instance metadata.
        Redis clusters are not currently supported; use of a local Redis
        instance is recommended.
        
        This module uses Boto3 to retrieve EC2 instance metadata from AWS. You
        should have a working AWS API environment (~/.aws/credentials,
        environment variables, or EC2 IAM Role) that allows calling EC2's
        ``describe-instances`` method against the account that Squid is running
        in.
