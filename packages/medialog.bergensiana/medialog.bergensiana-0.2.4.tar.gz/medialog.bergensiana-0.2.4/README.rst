=================================

A Plone theme by Espen Moe-Nilssen
 

This is a theming product for Plone 5

It is in beta, but since there are no other Plone 5 themes I have decided to release it

 

1) Install the theme

2) Configure E-mail

3) Configure Settings in Medialog Control Panel For the googlemap, you need the embed URL

4) Go to the front page with a browser that is NOT logged in

5) Decide which parts you dont want on your site / front-page

6) If you dont want the 'More services part', delete the 'More services' folder, if you dont want the portefolio, delete the 'Portefolio' folder

7) Add / edit stuff in folders

8) If you need the extra portlets managers, there are two more profiles which you can install from /portal_setup

9) To change the icons you will have to enable iconpicker behavior for the content type

 

Note of warning: As this is still beta, adding subfolders etc. in folders might give you errors. Manage portlets: Top portlets is not working yet. Do not rebuild LESS
