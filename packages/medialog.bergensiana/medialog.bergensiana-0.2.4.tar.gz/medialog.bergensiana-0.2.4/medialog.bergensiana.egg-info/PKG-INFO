        A Plone theme by Espen Moe-Nilssen
         
        
        This is a theming product for Plone 5
        
        It is in beta, but since there are no other Plone 5 themes I have decided to release it
        
         
        
        1) Install the theme
        
        2) Configure E-mail
        
        3) Configure Settings in Medialog Control Panel For the googlemap, you need the embed URL
        
        4) Go to the front page with a browser that is NOT logged in
        
        5) Decide which parts you dont want on your site / front-page
        
        6) If you dont want the 'More services part', delete the 'More services' folder, if you dont want the portefolio, delete the 'Portefolio' folder
        
        7) Add / edit stuff in folders
        
        8) If you need the extra portlets managers, there are two more profiles which you can install from /portal_setup
        
        9) To change the icons you will have to enable iconpicker behavior for the content type
        
         
        
        Note of warning: As this is still beta, adding subfolders etc. in folders might give you errors. Manage portlets: Top portlets is not working yet. Do not rebuild LESS
