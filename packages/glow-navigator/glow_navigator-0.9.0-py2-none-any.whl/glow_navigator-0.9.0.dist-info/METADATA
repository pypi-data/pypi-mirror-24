Glow Navigator Project
======================

This is a prototype for use with the Glow app designer tool developed at WiseTech Global (where I work).

The project uses a directed graph approach to map the relationship between different objects such as

- form-flows
- templates (pages and forms)
- conditions
- command rules
- images

The user can interrogate the graph using regex to locate nodes of interest and to then explore the connections (nodes) between the predecessors (parents or callers) and the successors (children or callees) to understand the relationship between the various objects.
