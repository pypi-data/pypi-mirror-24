= Subconvert 0.6.2 changelog

NOTE: Subconvert wasn't using Semantic Versioning at this point

== Changes since 0.6.1:

=== New features

*  mplayer auto-check more movie formats: mkv, mpg, mp4 and wmv

*  handle multiple input files

*  option to specify output file(s) extension

=== Bug fixes

*  SubRip incorrect parsing (trivia: in my test subtitles a word which starts
   with 'f' appears for the first time in 119th subtitle)

*  not clear notifications about parsing and IO operations state + add some more
   info to verbose output
