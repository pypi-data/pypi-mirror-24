== Property Files

Property Files let you group together frequently used options into a _rules_
which can be re-used for different subtitle files:

* FPS setting and automatic FPS detection;
* changing and detecting encodings;
* changing formats.

=== Using Property Files

Property Files can be easily applied to subtitles both in CLI and GUI mode:

* in CLI mode use *-p --pfile=_FILE_* switch:
+
----
$ subconvert -c -p props.spf subs.txt
----

* in GUI mode select subtitles for which you want to use Property Files (you can
  select multiple files e.g. by holding kbd:[shift] or kbd:[ctrl]), then right
  click anywhere on file list and select "Use Subtitle Properties". You can
  select from recently used Property Files or you can open one from arbitrary
  location.

The easiest way to create a new Property File is to use the Editor located at

following options:
