== Program Options

The most simple Subconvert call contains only list of files to be opened:

----
$ subconvert [FILE [FILE ...]]
----

Above call is the most complex one that starts <<gui>> (although it also can be
started without giving any initial files). If you'd like to perform a quick
converting task however, you have to add *-c* switch:

----
$ subconvert -c FILE [FILE ...]
----

After running this command Subconvert will convert requested files according to
any given options. In CLI mode converted subtitles are outputted to stdout
(terminal) by default.

Now there are some additional options available.

=== Processing subtitles

*-o, --output-file*=_FILE_::

By default Subconvert prints converted subtitles to stdout. You can instead
request writing them to file(s) by passing *-o* option followed by so-called
<<faq-output-syntax,output file syntax>>. It can be as simple as a single file
name, but it isn't very useful if you're converting more than one subtitles file
at once (as it would write all subtitles to that single file, effectively
rewriting it). You'll probably want to at least use `%f` specifier and maybe
`%e`, which stand for "original filename" and "original extension":
+
----
$ subconvert -c sub1.txt sub2.txt -t srt -o '%f.srt'
----
+
If output file already exists (and unless *-f* option is enabled), Subconvert
will fall back to interactive mode and ask you what to do next (overwrite,
backup, skip that file or cancel all operations).
+
Examples:
+
----
$ subconvert -c sub.srt -o sub.txt                        # results with sub.txt
$ subconvert -c sub1.srt sub2.txt -o prefix_%f.%e_suffix  # results with prefix_sub1.srt_suffix
----

*-t, --format*=_FMT_::

Probably the most important Subconvert feature (the one it got its name from) is
*converting* from one type of subtitles to another one (like from Subrip to
Micro DVD). That's what this option does: changes format of all newly created
files.
+
If this option is not used, format of original subtitles will be preserved.
+
For a list of available formats see <<formats>> page.
+
Examples:
+
----
$ subconvert -c sub.srt -t subviewer
----

*-e, --encoding*=_IN_ENC_::
*-E, --reencode*=_OUT_ENC_::

By default Subconvert will try to automatically detect subtitle encodings and
keep it for output files. But detecting file encodings is quite hard (really, it
is!), so it might detect it incorrectly or not detect it at all and fall back to
the default one, which doesn't have to be correct. If you'd like to force input
file encoding, you can use *-e* option.
+
On the other hand, for some reasons (say, your player only only handles one
encoding) you might want to change the output file encoding. To do that, use
*-E* option (capital "E").
+
When writing to a terminal, Subconvert doesn't automatically convert subtitles
to terminal's encoding, but preserves the meaning of *-e* and *-E* options as
described above. If input file's encoding is different than the terminal's one,
this might end up with displaying some meaningless characters. To avoid that you
can pass your terminal's encoding via *-E* option or you can pipe Subconvert's
output e.g. to `enconv` (available on virtually all distributions as a part of
`enca` package):
+
----
$ subconvert -c -e windows-1250 sub.srt | enconv
----
+
Note that those two options are independent, so you can auto detect input
encoding and change it to desired one. Just remember that it might be impossible
to convert one encoding to another one (like Japanese to Latin), so use these
options with caution.
+
If you are unsure about encodings you'd like to use, it's probably the best to
run a graphical interface and experiment with encodings to find a correct one
(i.e. the one without silly characters in your subtitles).
+
See also: <<encodings>>
+
Examples:
+
----
$ subconvert -c -e windows-1250 -E iso-885902 sub.srt
----

*-p PFILE, --property-file*=_PFILE_::

Property Files are a nice feature that allows you to easily use frequently used
options. Say, you mostly convert subtitles to a specific encoding and format. It
means that each time you'd have to type those options by hand (or create an
alias, which is fine too). With Property Files you don't have to do that because
you can group these options in a single file and ask Subconvert to use it
instead. For more informations see <<property-files>> page.
+
Examples:
+
----
$ subconvert -c -p my_properties.spf subtitles.txt
----

*--sync*=_SPEC_::

If subtitles are out of sync, you can synchronize them either by telling
Subconvert the offset by which it should change all subtitles or by giving one
or more synchronization points to which it should adjust subtitles.
+
To offset subtitles, simply tell by what time subtitles should be changed.
+
----
--sync "+15s"
--sync "-2s"
--sync "+1h 2m 10s 3ms"
----
+
NOTE: Quotes around _SPEC_ in above examples prevent problems with parsing time
specification by shells.
+
Time specification is composed of number of hours, minutes, seconds and
milliseconds, each of them is optional as long as there's at least one of them.
Time specification can be also negative -- in that case it will be subtracted
from each sutitle.
+
_SPEC_ for synchronization is very similar to the above one. It is composed of
comma-separated list of subtitle numbers and their times (which can be either
relative -- it's indicated by a plus or minus sign -- or absolute). Subtitle
numbering starts from 1 and can be negative. Negative subtitles are counted from
the end (so -1 is last subtitle, -2 is second to last and so on). At least one
subtitle number is required.
+
Other subtitles will be synchronized to the ones given in _SPEC_. Their times
will be computed to smoothly match requested synchronization points.
+
For example, below _SPEC_ means that the first subtitle is 2 seconds too early
(so we want to add 2 seconds to it) and the last subtitle is 3 seconds too late
(so we want to subtract 3 seconds from it).
+
----
--sync "1:+2s, -1:-3s"
----
+
Below example adds few milliseconds to the first and second subtitles and sets
the last one to the fixed time of 1 hour 15 minutes and 4 seconds:
+
----
--sync "1: +2ms, 2: +3ms, -1: 1h15m4s"
----

=== Processing videos

*--fps NUMBER*::
*-v VIDEO, --video VIDEO*::

Without <<fps,FPS>> value converting between time-based and frame-based
subtitles (e.g.  Subrip -> Micro DVD) is impossible. That's why Subconvert
employs several methods of obtaining this crucial value from a movie associated
with subtitles.
+
If you wish to manually pass video framerate to Subconvert, you'll can use
*--fps* switch. Let's say that you'd like to use '23.976' as your FPS value:
+
----
$ alias subconvert="subconvert -t microdvd" # assume for all examples
                                            # in this section that we'd like
                                            # to convert from subrip to microdvd

$ subconvert -c --fps 23.976 subtitles.srt
----
+
By default Subconvert will try to find and use framerate of a movie with similar
file name to the one of subtitles. If video file name doesn't match subtitles'
one, you can hard set a _VIDEO_ file for each of your subtitles. What is more,
you can use similar syntax to the <<faq-output-syntax,output file syntax>>: `%f`
will be replaced with a subtitle file name and `%e` with extension (although
using %e is not very useful):
+
----
$ subconvert -c -v "%f.avi" sub1.srt sub2.srt  # will search for
                                               # sub1.avi and sub2.avi

# subconvert -c -v common_video.avi sub1.srt sub2.srt  # for both subtitles
                                                       # FPS of common_video.avi
                                                       # will be used
----

=== Other options

*-f, --force*::
  assume 'yes' when Subconvert would normally ask for your permission (e.g.
  whether to overwrite existing file or not)

*--debug*::
  show some debug prints. Useful for developers or when reporting a bug.

*--quiet*::
  the opposite of *--debug*. Subconvert will print only when there's a critical
  error of some kind.

*--help*::
  displays a built-in help with a summary of all Subconvert options.

*--version*::
  displays used version of Subconvert
