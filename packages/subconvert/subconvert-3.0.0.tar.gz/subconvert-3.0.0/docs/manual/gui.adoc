== Graphical User Interface

=== Window layout

Main Subconvert window consists of several of tabs and panels.

.Main window
include::{snipdir}/image.adoc[tag=right]

First tab (named _Subtitles_) is always a **file list**. You cannot close it or
move it. It contains a list of *loaded* files with several handy informations
about them plus an icon representing current state of file status.  If file's
modified somehow, it changes to a yellow star. If it's "clean" (i.e.  not
modified), it changes to a green tick.

Next tabs (second one, third one and so on) contain **opened subtitle files**.
New tabs are not opened by default. To *open* a file in a new tab double click
on it on a file list. To open a file in new tab in background middle-click it.

Above the file list there's a **video player** panel. It shows currently opened
video file and its state. You can toggle its visibility under
`View/Movie player` menu.

On the left there's a **side panel**. It contains several tools, each
responsible for a different thing:

include::{snipdir}/image.adoc[tag=right]

To open a file click menu:File[Open]. File dialog will appear from which you
can select one or more files. Opened files will appear on a file list and if
there was any error, it will be displayed in another dialog.

==== Editing files separately

To open a file in a new tab, where it can be edited, double-click on it. To open
more files at once, select them from the right-click menu choose _Open in tab_
position. New tabs will be opened right to the file list tabs.

You can select many files at once just as you would do that in many other
well-known graphical applications:

* by clicking and dragging your mouse over several elements;
* by selecting separate items while holding kbd:[ctrl];
* by clicking on one item, holding kbd:[shift] and selecting the other one.

When on file tab, you can edit the following global properties of subtitles from
_Subtitles_ menu:

* format
* frames per second of subtitles
* file encodings
* offset time of subtitles

You can also link file with a specific video from which Subconvert will
automatically detect FPS value.

.Error indicator when changing subtitle time
include::{snipdir}/image.adoc[tag=right]

You can add, remove and change specific subtitles by selecting a wanted action
in _Subtitles_  menu or by right-clicking on any displayed subtitle. Subtitle's
text, start time and end time can be edited by double-clicking it.

To save changes click menu:File[Save].

==== Batch editing

You can change global properties of many subtitles at once by performing the
following actions:

1. make sure you have file list currently opened
2. select files you want to change;
3. right-click on files and select wanted actions from a displayed menu.

To save all changes at once click menu:File[Save all].

==== Edit history

[.right.text-right.related.thumb]
:img-file: history-of-changes.png
.History of changes
include::{snipdir}/image.adoc[tag=right]

History of all changes is recorded so all actions are reversible. This applies
to both batch edits and individual file edits.

_Undo_ and _redo_ buttons are available in _Subtitles_ menu and in file lists's
right-click menu (the latter one is batch undo/redo - it applies to all selected
files). Individual file history is also displayed in _History of changes_
sidebar tab. From there you can undo/redo many changes at once.

=== Playing videos

Subconvert automatically loads videos which share a filename with subtitles'
file. Video player can be toggled from menu:View[Video player].
