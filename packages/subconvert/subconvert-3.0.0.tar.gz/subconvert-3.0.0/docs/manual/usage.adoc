== Usage

TIP: You can always get a brief, up-to-date explanation of all Subconvert
options by calling `subconvert --help`.

=== Starting Subconvert

You can use Subconvert both as a console or a <<gui,graphical>> application. By
default Subconvert is started in a graphical mode. It installs itself
into most menus under *Audio/Video* category. Program launchers like Gnome-Do,
Kupfer or rofi should recognize it as well. If your File Manager supports such
behaviour, you can right-click on subtitle file, select *Open With...* (or a
similar option) and choose Subconvert as your desired editor for subtitle files.

To start it from command line, simply call:

----
$ subconvert [options] [subtitles]
----

If you wish to run Subconvert as a console script, add `-c` option. In CLI mode
Subconvert will perform a requested job and quit.

----
$ subconvert -c [options] subtitles
----
