Pyx12 is a HIPAA X12 document validator and converter. It parses an ANSI X12N data file and
validates it against a representation of the Implementation Guidelines for a HIPAA transaction. By default, it
creates a 997 response for 4010 and a 999 response for 5010. It can create an html representation of the X12
document or can translate to and from an XML representation of the data file.
