Django http monitor is a Django app for record http request and response in debug.

Django http monitor is based on response header `Request-UUID`, anyone has any questions about the request, just send me `Request-UUID` in response header, we can see whole message what we what.

## Quick start

### Install

```
pip install django-http-monitor
```

### Install apps

Add "http_monitor" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [

    'http_monitor',
]
```

### Include url

Include the http monitor URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

```
url(r'^http_monitor/', include('http_monitor.urls')),

### Add middleware
Add the HttpMonitorMiddleware for monitor request like this::

```
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
