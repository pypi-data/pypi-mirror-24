Description: 
        iplookup
        ========
        A small python module which accepts a single domain as a string, or multiple domains as a list, and returns a list of associated IPs (from both A record and CNAMEs).
        
        * For domains with multiple A records (RRDNS), all A record IPs are returned
        * IPv6 AAAA records are currently _NOT_ returned.
        * For domains which are CNAMEs, the IP of the CNAME is returned
        * If you give it an IP, it will return the IP back (so mixed lists are OK too)
        
        Install::
          pip install iplookup
        
        Usage::
          from iplookup import iplookup
        
          print(iplookup(["google.com", "example.com"]))
        
          print(iplookup("yahoo.com"))
