# SolidsPy: 2D-Finite Element Analysis with Python


![Wrench under bending.](./docs/img/wrench.png)

This _repo_ contains a simple finite element analysis code for 2D elasticity
problems. The code uses as input data simple-to-create text files containing
nodal, element, material and load data.

The _repo_ contains 3 main folders:

1. `solidspy/` stores the package routines:

    - `solids_GUI.py`: run the program;
    - `preprocesor.py` model input subroutines);
    - `assemutil.py` (assembly subroutines);
    - `femutil.py` (general finite element method subroutines);
    - `uelutil.py` (local matrix subroutines for different elements; and
    - `postprocesor.py` (results handling subroutines)

2. `meshes/` contains input files and meshes in `.msh` format corresponding to
    different examples.

3. `docs/` contains the documentation files.

4. `examples/` contains some examples of the use of the package.

5. `tests/` contains unit testing.

## Authors
- [Juan David Gómez Cataño](http://www.eafit.edu.co/docentes-investigadores/Paginas/juan-gomez.aspx),
    Professor at Universidad EAFIT.

    Purdue University.

## Installation
The code is written in Python and it depends on `numpy`, `scipy` and `sympy`.

To run the examples with GUI input you will need to install
[`easygui`](http://easygui.readthedocs.org/en/master/). And, you will
need [`meshio`](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) to automatically read
[Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) mesh files. These two can be installed with

    pip install easygui
    pip install meshio

To install _SolidsPy_ use

    pip install solidspy

## Run a simple model
After installation, you can run an analysis in 3 easy steps (see [template](./docs/template/README.md)):
- Create the mesh using [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/).
- Generate the model files (eles.txt, nodes.txt, mater.txt and loads.txt) using
  a python script with the aid of [`meshio`](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio).
- Run it in Python

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # load matplotlib
from solidspy import solids_GUI  # import our package
solids_GUI()  # run the Finite Element Analysis
plt.show()    # plot contours
```
