      "We discuss the implications of studies of partition function zeros and equimodular curves for the analytic properties of the Ising model on a square lattice in a magnetic field. In particular we consider the dense set of singularities in the susceptibility of the Ising model at $H=0$ found by Nickel and its relation to the analyticity of the field theory computations of Fonseca and Zamolodchikov. Curator change.\n"
