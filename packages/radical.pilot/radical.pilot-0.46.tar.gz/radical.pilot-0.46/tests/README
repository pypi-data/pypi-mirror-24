how to enable / disable tests?
------------------------------

  - resources for mpi and integration tests are enabled / disabled in
    jenkins.cfg
  - other individual test scripts are enabled/disabled in jenkins_issues.cfg
  - ssh credentials need to be added to jenkins directly
  - the ssh configuration in test_ssh.cfg is copied to ~jenkins/.ssh/comfig
    before tests are running.
