    ComputePilot State Model
    ------------------------
    
    .. image:: images/pilot_state_model.png
    
    #. A new compute pilot is launched via :func:`radical.pilot.PilotManager.submit_pilots`
    
    #. The pilot is submitted to the remote resource and enters ``LAUNCHING`` state.
    
    #. The pilot has been succesfully launched on the remote machine and is now waiting to become ``ACTIVE``.
    
    #. The pilot has been launched by the queueing system and is now in ``ACTIVE STATE``.
    
    #. The pilot has finished execution regularly and enters ``DONE`` state.
    
    #. An error has occured during preparation for pilot launching and the pilot enters ``FAILED`` state.
    
    
    #. An error has occured during pilot launching and the pilot enters ``FAILED`` state.
    
    #. An error has occured on the backend and the pilot couldn't become active and the pilot enters ``FAILED`` state.
    
    #. An error has occured during pilot runtime and the pilot enters ``FAILED`` state.
    
    #. The active pilot has been canceled via the :func:`radical.pilot.ComputePilot.cancel` call and enters ``CANCELED`` state.
    
    
    State Model Evolution
    ----------------------
    
    The RADICAL-Pilot state model is evolving over time.  Below are the past,
    current and future Compute unit states, and their (expected) definitions and mappings:
    
    Unit states up to version 0.27:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
          NEW                     - created in    umgr
          UNSCHEDULED             - passed  to    umgr scheduler, but not assigned to a pilot
          PENDING_INPUT_STAGING   - passed  to    staging-in, assigned to a pilot, waiting for file staging
          STAGING_INPUT           - picked  up by staging-in, transfering files (in umgr and/or agent)
          PENDING_EXECUTION       - passed  to    agent scheduler, agent waiting to assign cores
          SCHEDULING              - picked  up by agent scheduler, attempts to assign cores for execution
          EXECUTING               - picked  up by agent exec worker, cu is consuming cores
          PENDING_OUTPUT_STAGING  - passed  to    staging-out, execution done, waiting for file transfer
          STAGING_OUTPUT          - picked  up by staging-out, transferring files  (in umgr and/or agent)
          DONE                    - final
          CANCELED                - final
          FAILED                  - final
    
    Unit states in version 0.28:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
          NEW                     - created in    umgr
          UNSCHEDULED             - passed  to    umgr scheduler, but not assigned to a pilot
          SCHEDULING              - picked  up by umgr scheduler, assigning cu to a pilot

          STAGING_INPUT           - picked  up by staging-in, transfering files (in umgr and/or agent)
          PENDING_EXECUTION       - passed  to    agent scheduler, agent waiting to assign cores
          ALLOCATING              - picked  up by agent scheduler, attempts to assign cores for execution
          EXECUTING               - picked  up by agent exec worker, cu is consuming cores
          PENDING_OUTPUT_STAGING  - passed  to    staging-out, execution done, waiting for file transfer
          STAGING_OUTPUT          - picked  up by staging-out, transferring files  (in umgr and/or agent)
          DONE                    - final
          CANCELED                - final
          FAILED                  - final
    
    Unit states after module refactoring:

          UMGR_STAGING_INPUT_PENDING   - passed  to    umgr  staging-in, pilot is assigned
          UMGR_STAGING_INPUT           - picked  up by umgr  staging-in, performing file staging
