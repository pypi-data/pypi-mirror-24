************************
Staging Unit Output Data
************************

Upon completion, CUs have often creates some amount of data. We have seen in
:ref:`chapter_user_guide_01` how we can inspect the CU's ``stdout`` string -- but
that will not be useful beyond the most trivial workloads.  This section
introduces how created data can be staged back to the RP application, and/or
staged to 3rd party storage.

Output staging is in principle specified just like the input staging discussed
in the ref:`previous <chapter_user_guide_05>` section:

  * ``source``: what data files need to be staged from the context of the finished CU;
  * ``target``: where should the data be staged to;
  * ``action``: how should data be staged.

In this example we actually use the long form, and specify the output file name
to be changed to a unique name during staging:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(0, n):
        cud.executable     = '/bin/cp'
        cud.arguments      = ['-v', 'input.dat', 'output.dat']
        cud.input_staging  = ['input.dat']
        cud.output_staging = {'source': 'output.dat', 
                              'target': 'output_%03d.dat' % i,
                              'action': rp.TRANSFER}

:download:`06_unit_output_data.py <../../../examples/06_unit_output_data.py>`
contains an example application which uses the above code block.  It otherwise
does not significantly differ from our previous example.


Running the Example
-------------------

The result of this example's execution shows that the output files have been
renamed during the output-staging phase:

.. image:: 06_unit_output_data.png


What's Next?
------------

As we are now comfortable with input and output staging, we will next look into
an optimization which is important for a large set of use cases: the
:ref:`sharing of input data <chapter_user_guide_07>` between multiple compute
units.
