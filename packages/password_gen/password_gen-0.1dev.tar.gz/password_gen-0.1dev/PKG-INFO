Description: During my recent encounter on an article about the vulnerability of weak passwords,
        I was enlightened on the dangers of weak passwords, which includes single-handedly serving as the "weakest link" to a web server.
        In details, if my weak password is guessed by an hacker, the whole web server of the site is vulnerable.
        
        # password-generator:
        CLI program that generates a memorable, but absolutely random, password. The password generated would have four words seperated by either digits or special characters.
        
        # "I want to use it":
        Feel free to clone/fork it.
        ## Before runnning `create.py`:
        You'll need to fill in:
        1. `env/env.sh`: the default values for the range of values.
        EX: DIG_START='2', DIG_STOP='6'. This sets the range for DIGITS to [2,6]. The generator will randomly use a digit between 2 and 6.
        
        **Make sure the range for CHARACTERS is valid ascii values for special characters.**
        
        2. `create.py`: dictionary.txt, which holds the words used by the generator.
        You can create yours by getting a datasets of words (from sources like [google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)) and using `scraper.py` to save words to dictionary.txt.
        
        **Make sure to set the file paths in `create.py`, and `scraper.py` if you'll use it.**
        ## Program output:
        For readaility, spaces are added to the password generated.
        # Future updates:
        1. Error handling
        2. REST API
