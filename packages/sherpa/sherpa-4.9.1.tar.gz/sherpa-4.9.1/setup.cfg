# the cfitsio, CCfits, and wcs libraries used in the build
# (an example is cfitsio_3.37, CCfits_2.4, and wcs-4.20).

# used to configure the build, with <os name>/lib appended to
# it, where <os name> looks something like
# 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-libc2.21-0'). The cfitsio_lib_dirs,
# ccfits_lib_dirs, and wcslib_lib_dirs will need to be set if
# these libraries are installed in a different location.

# If you are building against the XSPEC libraries provided as
# part of CIAO then set xspec_lib_dirs to $ASCDS_INSTALL_LIB/ots
