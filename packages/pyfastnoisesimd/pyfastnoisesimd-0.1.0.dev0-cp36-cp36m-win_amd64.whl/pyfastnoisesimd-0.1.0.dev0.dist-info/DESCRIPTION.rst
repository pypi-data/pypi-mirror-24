FastNoise SIMD is the SIMD implementation of my noise library FastNoise. It aims
to provide faster performance through the use of intrinsic(SIMD) CPU functions. 
Vectorisation of the code allows noise functions to process data in sets of 
4/8/16 increasing performance by 700% in some cases (Simplex).
