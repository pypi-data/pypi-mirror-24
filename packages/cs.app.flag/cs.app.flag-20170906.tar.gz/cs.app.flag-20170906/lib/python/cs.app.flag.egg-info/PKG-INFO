Description: Filesystem visible boolean flags
        for control and status,
        allowing easy monitoring of services or other status,
        and control by flag management
        for programmes which also monitor the flags.
        
        The flags are expressed as individual files with uppercase names
        in a common directory ($HOME/var/flags by default);
        an empty or missing file is "false"
        and a nonempty file is "true".
        
        The Flags class provides easy Pythonic access.
        If presents as a modifiable mapping whose keys are the flag names.
        
        The is also a FlaggedMixin class providing convenient methods and attributes
        for maintaining a collection of flags associated with some object
        with flag names prefixed by the object's .name attribute uppercased and with an underscore appended::
        
          class SvcD(...,FlaggedMixin):
            def __init__(self, name, ...)
              self.name = name
              FlaggedMixin.__init__(self)
              ...
            def disable(self):
              self.flag_disabled = True
            def restart(self):
              self.flag_restart = True
            def _restart(self):
              self.flag_restart = False
              ... restart the SvcD ...
