Description: Scripting is a boilerplate library for one-off Python scripts when you don't have an IDE or the like to work with. It
        was primarily designed for Windows where scripts can be run via double-click, but it (probably) works just as well in
        a variety of situations.
        
        
        Here's an example what a script might look like pre-Scripting:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import traceback
        
        
            def do_something():
                ...
                return 200
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':  # Run as script
                try:  # Exceptions will close the terminal window
                    print(do_something())
                except Exception:
                    traceback.print_exc()  # Debug
                finally:
                    input()  # Keep the window open
        
        If all you're writing is a simple script and don't want to deal with extensive error handling, chances are you'll end
        up with something like the above. If you write such scripts often, however, the amount of boilerplate adds up and
        quickly becomes tedious to maintain.
        
        Post-Scripting:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import scripting
        
        
            @scripting.main
            def do_something():
                ...
                return 200
        
        Scripting takes care of exception handling, output formatting, and maintaining the terminal window for you so that you
        can focus on getting your script done in the shortest amount of time possible.
