Description: This package provides statistics methods for Maximum Accuracy Interval Arithmetic.
        
        The Interval Arithmetic is a mathematical tool for the solution of problems
        related to numerical errors, based on an algebraic system formed by all closed
        intervals of Real Line (or rectangles of Complex Plane) and operations defined
        on it. Rather than usual numerical algorithms, it's used interval algorithms
        producing intervals containing the correct answer as a result.
        
        The Maximum Accuracy, on the other hand, provides an axiomatic method for
        arithmetic operations performed in computers that capture essential properties
        associated with rounding.
        
        The studies on large amounts of data , one needs to descriptive statistics in order to 
        reduce the complexity of analyzing all the data. 
        But these acquired data must be reliable and accurate . 
        Thus joins use of the advantages of using descriptive statistics with the benefits provided by interval arithmetic .
        Thus this package have as objectives to provide methods for calculation of descriptive indicators
         to provide an automatic control errors and maximum accuracy.
