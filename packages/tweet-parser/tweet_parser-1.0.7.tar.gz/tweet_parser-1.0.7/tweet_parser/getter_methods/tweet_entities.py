def get_user_mentions(tweet):
    """
    Get the @-mentions in the Tweet as dictionaries.
    Note that in the case of a quote-tweet, this does not return the users
    mentioned in the quoted status. The recommended way to get that list would
    be to use get_user_mentions on the quoted status.
    Also note that in the caes of a quote-tweet, the list of @-mentioned users
    does not include the user who authored the original (quoted) Tweet.

    Args:
        tweet (Tweet or dict): A Tweet object or dictionary

    Returns:
        list (list of dicts): 1 item per @ mention. Note that the fields here
        aren't enforced by the parser, they are simply the fields as they
        appear in a Tweet data payload.

    Example:


    Example:
        >>> from tweet_parser.getter_methods.tweet_entities import get_user_mentions
        >>> original = {"created_at": "Wed May 24 20:17:19 +0000 2017",
