QiPy
====================

QiPy is a Python library to work with `quadratic integers`_. Well-known examples
are `Gaussian integers`_ and `Eisenstein integers`_. Besides,
QiPy implements ideals, `ideal classes`_ and `class groups`_ of
quadratic integer rings.

This library has been exhaustively tested with unit tests and `property testing`_.

A complete documentation of QiPy, including examples of all its funcionalities,
can be found in the `GitHub Page`_ of the repository.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

QiPy is written in Python 3 and uses the Python library SymPy_. Therefore,
Python 3 and SymPy must be installed in your computer.

The easiest way to install QiPy is with pip_ : ::

    pip3 install qipy
