Description: RPConnect
        #########
        
        Lightweight Remote Procedure Call framework.
        Only two components are of importance:
        
        ``RpcServer``
            A long-running server, where callables can be registered.
        
        ``remote_call``
            A single-use client, to call procedures on an RpcServer.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        On the server side, you can define and register callables.
        These are then exposed by name:
        
        .. code::
        
            def pingpong(*args, **kwargs):
                return args, kwargs
        
            with RpcServer(23000) as server:
                server.register(pingpong)
                server.run()
        
        On the client side, you can directly dispatch a ``remote_call``.
        This will block until a reply is available:
        
        .. code::
        
            remote_call('localhost', 23000, 'pingpong', 'hello', 'world')
        
        About
        -----
        
        This is a simple RPC library, primarily for prototyping and education setups.
        It uses a JSON based protocol, which protects against undesired code execution.
        Any complex protocols, such as packed or pickle based data, can be implemented on top.
