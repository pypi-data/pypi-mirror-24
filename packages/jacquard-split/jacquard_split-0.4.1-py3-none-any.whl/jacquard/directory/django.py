Django user directory.

This directory pulls data from an `auth_user` SQL table corresponding with
Django's `django.contrib.auth` user model. It uses the integer ID field as
the assumed form of user ID.

Tags are limited - it only has one tag, `superuser`. For superusers.

Potentially useful for small Django projects, or as a superclass for a more
intricate Django user directory.
