	  doc/pyplots/plot_speed.py,
	  doc/pyplots/plot_temperature.py,
	  doc/pyplots/plot_velocity.py,
	  doc/pyplots/stylesheet_gallery.py:

	Do not import typhon.plots explicitly as it is imported using
	every typhon import.

	Use the rasterized option when using `pcolormesh`. This should
	decrease the build time significantly.

2017-08-27  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/typhon.math.rst: Added `squeezable_logspace`.

	Moved documentation of workspace module to separate file.
	This file can be excluded when the documentation is build
	without ARTS API.

	Fixed references for automodules for some modules (most likely
	copy and paste remnants.)

	* doc/conf.py:

	Exclude `typhon.arts.workspace.rst` for builds without ARTS API.

	Removed shlex from list of imports as it was not used.

	* doc/modules.rst: Include typhon.arts.workspace to toctree.

2017-08-26  Simon Pfreundschuh <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	function syntax


2017-08-25  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py(SRF.make_lookup_table):

	- fill value for high end should be something ridiculously high, not
	0.  Arguably bounds_error should be True, or some iterative method to
	estimate BTs should be used when out of range, but the former is too
	inflexible and the latter is too much work to implement right now, in
	particular with vectorisation in mind.

2017-08-25  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/math/common.py (squeezable_logspace):

	causing a segfault.

2017-08-24  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS._read):

	- Bugfix: apply filter firstline before trying any calibration, and
	outside of it.

	output warning. Prevents nosetests from failing.

	* typhon/arts/workspace/api.py:

	Simplify arts_build_path check.

	Fix typo.

2017-08-22  Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* doc/typhon.arts.rst: Added workspace sub-module to sphinx documentation.

	* typhon/arts/workspace/__init__.py: Module file for new workspace
	sub-module.

	- Remove overlaps before, not after, removing lines due to time
	sequence errors, to stop counting errors

	- Handle situation where dataname is empty, such as for TIROS-N

	(HIRS._filter_firstline):

	- Handle situation where dataname is empty, such as for TIROS-N

	(HIRS._update_firstline_db):

	- Handle situation where dataname is empty, such as for TIROS-N
	- When lines are out of order, do not use the last line of the
	previous granule as a firstline-db reference, but use the one with the
	latest time (.max()). 

	(HIRS.get_dataname):

	- Update to new API for get_dataname based on new need for HIRSPOD
	(see below)

	(HIRS.apply_calibcount_filter):

	- Update filter name

	(HIRS._convert_temp):

	- Use filterer provided for PRT temperature filter

	(HIRSPOD.get_dataname):

	- Handle situation where dataname is empty, such as for TIROS-N.  This
	has grown a robust-flag such that it either fails with ValueError or

	Improved usabilty of Timer class.

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py (Timer):

	It is possible to pass additional information on the process
	being timed using the `info` keyword. If no information is
	given, a default value depending on the context is used e.g. the
	function name when used as decorator.

	It is also possible to alter the timeformat.

	Removed unnecessary lines and updated docstrings.

2017-08-18  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py: Added len for ArrayOfLineRecord.  
	Added __repr__ for CIARecord
	
	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py: Changed repr to be more informative when
	names are not given.  When you use repr, the true value of None is not
	important.  Also changed so refining grids work for over-dimensioned
	fields (e.g., if you need gridded field for more than one latitude, but 
	field is only available for one latitude, then this can expand it)
	
	* typhon/geodesy/__init__.py:  Bug-fix and added simple line-sphere 
	intersection helper function.
	
2017-08-17  John Mrziglod  <mrzo@gmx.de>

	- Don't cont.load() when empty, otherwise we trigger
	https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1329

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS._read):

	- Catch the situation where time has duplicates but scanline number
	does not

	* typhon/utils/__unit__.py(concat_each_time_coordinate):

	otherwise we trigger https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1329

2017-07-25  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/atmosphere.py(relative_humidity):

	- Fix typo in docstring

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset._add_gran_to_data):

	- For slices, ensure we're doing a<=x<b, i.e. include the start but
	not the end, such that asking for [a, b], then [b, c] will never
	include a duplicate point, which can happen if there is a measurement
	exactly at b.

	tests.

2017-07-23  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(DatasetDeque.move):

2017-07-22  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	(Dataset._ensure_large_enough) (Dataset._add_pseudo_fields)
	(Dataset._read_ndarray):

	- Don't convert regular ndarrays into masked arrays

	(DatasetDeque.move):
	
	- Base new edges on self.edges as well as self.data["time"], otherwise
	we may be consistently off forever if we start off with partly
	unreadable data

	passed on to read_period.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.apply_calibcount_filter):

2017-07-07  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py, typhon/datasets/dataset.py,
	typhon/datasets/tovs.py, typhon/plots/common.py,
	typhon/utils/__init__.py, typhon/utils/metaclass.py:

	At all places where we derive code from Stack Overflow, point out
	that either this has to be CC-BY-SA 3.0 licensed, or that we believe
	it does not count as a derivative work.  I am not convinced the former
	is enough, but it's better than nothing.  See e-mail to typhon mailing
	list 2017-07-07 titled “A warning on using code snippets from Stack
	Overflow”.

2017-07-07  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read):

	- Do not impose dependencies of my_pseudo_fields when those fields
	were not asked for in the reader

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:
	
	(HIRS._read):

	- Comment out catch_warnings as long as bug at
	http://bugs.python.org/issue29672 remains.  Be aware that the
	resulting warning is spurious, such as confirmed at
	https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8383

	(HIRS.as_xarray_dataset):

	- Only assign lon/lat coordinates if lon/lat actually present in
	fields.

2017-06-28  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	- Don't log on root level, as if this happens before
	logging.basicConfig was set, this will become ineffective!

2017-06-28  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* README.md: Updated installation recommendations.

	The installation guide for developers now includes a hint to
	install the package in the home directory not system wide.

	* typhon/plots/common.py (label_axes): Minor change in example.

2017-06-17  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/common.py (label_axes):

	Function add a label to each axis in a figure conveniently.

	* doc/typhon.plots.rst: Added `label_axes()` to documentation.

2017-06-16  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset):

	- Rather than hardcoding time-field to be "time", set this in an
	attribute.  For some datasets it may be "date"?

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.__init__):

	- Set start_date, end_date from _tovs_defs.HIRS_periods

2017-06-12  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS2):

	- Add more aliases for referring to older satellites.

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py(SRF.estimate_band_coefficients):

	- In ad-hoc band correction estimate method, fix regular expression so
	that it works for older HIRS (before NOAA-10).  This contributes to
	the fix of HIRS FCDR #110.

2017-06-12  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Add some of the flags used in HIRS/2, HIRS/3, HIRS/4.  For now only
	adding the flags I'm acting upon, others later.  Currently used for
	FCDR HIRS processing.  Note that to make full use of these flags you
	want to use Python 3.6, but it should be possible to use them in
	Python 3.5 as well, just more in a more limited way.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRSKLM.get_mask_from_flags):

	- Added note/reminder to self to migrate hardcoded bitmasks to flag
	positinos defined in _tovs_defs.py

2017-06-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/physics/em.py (planck, planck_wavelength, planck_wavenumber,
	rayleighjeans_wavelength, radiance2planckTb, radiance2rayleighjeansTb,
	frequency2wavelength, wavelength2frequency, wavelength2wavenumber,
	wavenumber2wavelength):

	Introduce a np.divide to avoid a runtime error being thrown if function
	is called with a float instead of an numpy array. Now for all such
	cases a numpy warning is consistently issued.

	This makes the functions behave in line with how numpy's / scipy's own
	functions work. If the user wants to suppress the warning, the
	means numpy offers itself should be used for this, e.g.:

	with np.errstate(divide='ignore'):
	    radiance2plancktb(f, r)

2017-06-04  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* README.md: Added a short README file.

	The file is meant to give short instructions on how to get
	started when developing typhon.
	The common way to provide documentation is still Sphinx!

2017-05-31  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Added flag meanings for HIRS/3 and HIRS/4

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.verify_mandatory_fields):

	- Do not assume incorrect fields are passed as strings or will raise
	wrong exception.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS):
	
	- Remove spurious comment

2017-05-26  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Import `typhon.plots` by default.

	The plotting submodule is now automatically loaded when typhon
	is imported.

	* typhon/plots/plots.py:

	* (HectoPascalFormatter, HectoPascalLogFormatter):

	Added example plots and cross-references.

	Adapated test case to the fixed version of `planck_wavenumber`.

2017-05-18  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/em.py(planck_wavenumber): SERIOUS BUGFIX

	There was a typo in the equation.  If you ever used it, please retract
	all your papers and return your PhD and other degrees because the
	output was INCORRECT.

2017-05-18  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* Changed format for version number!

	* typhon/version.py:

	The format of the module version number has changed.
	The new format is recognized by pip (and IDEs like PyCharm).

	The new format is: <major>.<minor>.<micro><revision>

	change where I don't want to.

	- minorframe_quality_flags and angles only for HIRS/3/4

2017-05-05  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py:

	* (channels): Fixed handling of second offset.

	Now correctly used around the position of the first passband.

	Replaced the `partial` solution with an explicit function.
	This also allows a proper docstring.

	* (profile_p): Fixed docstring description (report by Oliver).

2017-05-05  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py (channels):

	Function to plot instrument channels for passband-type sensors.

	works again.

	- Renamed hrs_satloc for HIRS2, instead extract directly with height
	and lza.

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(HomemadeDataset.find_granule_for_time):

	- When estimating filename, pass on information for any attributes,
	not only the ones defined within the present class.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRSPOD.get_other):

	- Adapt lza_approx now that we extract height and lza individually.

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py(concat_each_time_coordinate):

	- Untimed vars should only be the data vars, not the coordinates.

2017-05-02  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py (deprecated):

	Allow to pass additional information message to the decorator.

2017-05-01  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py (deprecated):

	Decorator to raise a simple deprecation warning.

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py (load_directory):

	Improved readability and general function structure.

2017-04-25  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Adapted the typhon stylesheet to fit well with the changing
	defaults in matplotlib 2.0.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon-classic.mplstyle:

	The old typhon stylesheet.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon-fullcycler.mplstyle,
	  typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon-geometry.mplstyle:

	Removed the separate geoemetry and color-cycler as they are
	probably unused.

	when using the larger color-cycler in matplotlib 2.0.

	* typhon/math/common.py (nlogspace): Added example.

	* typhon/plots/plots.py: Removed forgotten debug `print()`.

	LineMixing, PressureBroadening, Rational and all imports not related
	to these
	
	* {typhon/arts/types.py,doc/typhon.arts.rst}: mimics catalogues for 
	internals.py classes

2017-04-13  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/conf.py: Added numpy yo list of interpshinx packages.

	Intersphinx now links to the Python 3.6 documentation.

	* typhon/math/common.py (integrate_column):

	Improved documentation of input parameters. Added an example to
	the docstring.

2017-04-13  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/math/common.py:

	* (integrate_column): Use `np.trapz` for integration.

	This allows more flexible usage of the function (e.g.
	multidimensional input).

	* (interpolate_halflayers):

	Function to return linear interpolated values for halflayers.

	* typhon/atmosphere.py (iwv): Support multidimensional input.

2017-04-11  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py: Add least_siginficant_digit hint, fix
	calendar coding

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Reading period of xarray now works!

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py: Some bugfixes

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py: Bugfixes

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py: Bugfixes
	
2017-04-07  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py:  Fixed an error I introduced in last
	entry.  Also added a partition_functions class to compute 
	partition sums the same way as in ARTS using the cross_section method
	of ARTSCAT5.  Can be initialized directly from SpeciesAuxData 
	(load arts-xml-data tips.xml).  Fun pass time: load some
	ARTSCAT5 lines from arts-xml-data (the Perrin-folder),
	also load the tips.xml file, and then run the cross-section
	calculations for a few temperatures, plotting the results, 
	to clearly see the distribution of line strengths shift from
	low to high frequencies as temperature increases

2017-04-07  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py:

	* (profile_p, profile_p_log, profile_z):

	Added functions for basic atomspheric profile plots.

	* (fmt_hectopascal):

	Formatter to create pretty hectopascal labels for profile plots.

	* doc/typhon.plots.rst: Added new functions to documentation.

2017-04-06  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset._add_gran_to_data):

	- Further preparation for supporting xarray

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.filter_firstline):

	- Did I just fix or introduce an off-by-one-bug?  Either way, this
	method is ultimately on its way out in favour of filter_bestline still
	to be implemented, so I will accept the risk of a off-by-minus-one bug
	for now.  But I seemed to be getting one duplicate line between
	adjecent granules.  I don't understand why.  Perhaps related to the
	work I've done on Dataset._add_gran_to_data and friends.

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py(UnitsAwareDataArray.to_root_units):

	- Like in pint.

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py:

	(get_time_coordinates): Bugfix.  Was only getting time *dimensions*,
	not time coordinates that are not also dimensions.

	(concat_each_time_coordinate): Much increased speed for larger arrays,
	although still much slower than concatenating ordinary ndarrays.  Now
	on CEMS it takes around 22 seconds to concatenate xarray datasets that
	end up being almost 9 GB.  NB: I will use this for the
	_add_gran_to_data crowd of methods for now instead of the increasingly
	complex approach I've been trying before.

2017-04-06  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/spectroscopy.py:

	Added `doppler_broadegning()`, `boltzmann_level()` and
	`stimulated_emission()` to the list of public functions.

	Removed try-except statement around import of constants.

	Small improvement of math typesetting in docstrings.

	* doc/typhon.spectroscopy.rst:

	Added `doppler_broadegning()`, `boltzmann_level()` and
	`stimulated_emission()` to the list of public functions.

2017-04-06  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/constants.py:  Added atomic mass unit to list of constants
	
	* typhon/spectroscopy.py:  Added doppler_broadening, boltzmann_level,
	and stimulated_emission functions to help compute parameters needed
	for line shapes and line strengths
	
	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py: Changed ARTSCAT5 to have a single append-
	method.  Added some descriptions to its methods.  Also added a 
	cross_section method to give a view of the cross section expected
	from the lines in the ARTSCAT5.  
	
	Made __repr__ for SpeciesAuxData.
	
	Added two ARTS internal classes LineMixing and PressureBroadening
	which deals with ARTSCAT5-style line mixing and pressure broadening.
	Both have copies of the computation routines in ARTS.  Neither is 
	extensively tested

2017-04-04  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py (image2mpeg):

	Wrapper for external command `ffmpeg` to convert a set of
	images into a video.

	* doc/typhon.utils.rst: Added `image2mpeg` to documentation.

2017-04-03  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py (__repr__):

	The old implementation failed to inspect the shape of non-array
	grids. Fixed this bug to allow the representation of lists
	(e.g. species in atm_fields_compact).

2017-03-31  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset(SatDataset._add_gran_to_data):

	- Proceeded with preparations for handling xarray datasets.  Work in
	progress.

	* typhon/math/stats.py(adev): Added clarifying comments

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py(UnitsAwareDataArray):

	- Added methods for handling reducing operations, starting with sum
	and diff but should probably be generalised to std, min, max, mean,
	and others.

2017-03-31  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/typhon.arts.rst: Included `ARTSCAT5`.

2017-03-31  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	* (check_atm_fields_compact):

	Started to implement a method to check, if a GriddedField fits
	the requirements of an atm_fields_compact.

	* (__repr__):

	Improved the robustness of the function. It now works even if
	the GriddedField name or the dataname is not set.

	* typhon/arts/scattering.py: Minor PEP8 fixes.

2017-03-31  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py:  Added ARTSCAT5-class.  Added
	some functionality to QuantumIdentifier, QuantumNumberRecord,
	and QuantumNumbers making them dictionaries with special rules
	and logic.  
	
	Also added Rational-class based on fractions.Fraction with special
	__repr__ rules to mimic ARTS Rational-class reading
	
	The logic in the quantum classes are such that == means all 
	quantum numbers are equal and no quantum numbers are missing, <=
	means all quantum numbers in the LHS are in RHS but that there could
	be more numbers in RHS that are ignored, and < means that there 
	has to be more numbers in RHS than LHS.  In all cases, the numbers
	that do exist must be consistent for truth. (!=, >= and > behave 
	as expected from the previous rules in a reverse manner.)
	This is different from pure numerical manipulation and is 
	more in line with set theory.  I.e., the logic asks for 
	complete overlap, some overlap, or strictly partial overlap of the 
	sets
	
	Likewise, mathematical operations += and -= are interpreted to mean 
	adding a new quantum number or removing and existing quantum number 
	rather than adding or removing a numerical value to the set
	
	This additions allows manipulation of LineRecord data via keys in 
	ARTSCAT5.changeForQN() with a few options
	
	Example: 
	
	cat = arts.xml.load('hitran2012.xml').as_ARTSCAT5(),
	cat.changeForQN(kind='keep', spec='O2', afgl=66,  qns={'v1': 0})
	cat.changeForQN(kind='add', information={'QN': {'S': 1}})
	arts.xml.save(cat, 'o2-groundstate.xml') 
	
	takes an xml-file throws away all lines  that are not 'O2-66' 
	lines with 'v1' quantum number of 0 in both upper and lower state 
	and then adds S=1 to all lines in both the upper and the lower
	levels list of quantum numbers.  Of course, such manipulation 
	only works when quantum numbers are known in the  first place.
	It also fails when the xml-file is not of ARTSCAT-5 type ---
	this can likely be easily fixed since both ARTSCAT-4 and 
        ARTSCAT-3 translates perfectly to ARTSCAT-5 but I have 
        not bothered with such implementation because I consider these
        other two formats unnecessary because of the compatibility.
	
	Question: Should these classes really be in this folder?
	ARTSCAT5 is a derived type and Rational is an internal type of 
	ARTS required to understand QuantumNumbers.  Neither is really
	a 'catalogue' or possible to catalogue-ize in xml-files
	
	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:  Changed gridded fields __repr__
	function to write the data, shapes, and grids on screen for 
	easier data sanity checks.  Uses the numpy printer options so
	by default the output is sane and if you are using less sane
	printer options you are probably aware of not evoking __repr__
	much

2017-03-31  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py (UnitsAwareDataArray.__array_wrap__):

	- Fix bug when calling log/exp on UADA that has units that are
	dimensionless but not "1" (such as m/km).  Should be normalised prior
	to calling exp or all hell will break loose.

2017-03-28  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	- Move some functionality to _apply_limits_and_filters and
	_add_gran_to_data and _correct_overallocation.

	- In those methods, add support for reading datasets that return
	xarray.Dataset.  Implementation is currently stupid and needs to be
	MUCH faster.

	(MultiFileDataset.get_mandatory_fields):

	- Bugfix, fields in subdir mandatory too

	(HomemadeDataset):

	flagging (actually they usually tell why we flagged at all).

2017-03-14  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	Calculate VMR for given relative humidity, pressure and temperature.

	* doc/typhon.atmosphere.rst: Added `vmr` to documentation.

2017-03-13  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.as_xarray_dataset):

	Convert ints to floats so that I can use nans for masking, as xarray
	does not support masking otherwise.

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py(SRF.estimate_band_coefficients):

	- Use band coefficients from file for now, ad-hoc solution.

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py(UnitsAwareDataArray):

	- Do not attempt to transfer units for ufuncs that return a boolean,
	like isfinite.

2017-03-10  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py:

	(Timer): Fixed docstring example.

	(print_timing): Added decorator for convenient function benchmarking.

	* doc/typhon.utils.rst: Added `print_timing` to docs.

2017-03-09  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/atmosphere.py (relative_humidty):

	Calculate relative humidity for given VMR, pressure and temperature.

	* doc/typhon.atmosphere.rst: Added `relative_humidity` to docs.

2017-03-08  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Change complevel to 4 as tests show that it gets much slower, but
	not much faster, at higher complevels

	- Fix typo in two field names

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py: Correct docstring

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py(SRF.as_dataarray): Added method to
	convert SRF to a data array (NB: using regular DataArray, not
	UnitAwareDataArray, because I have no way of keeping track of units on
	coordinates in UnitAwareDataArray at the moment).

2017-03-06  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py: Simplified code around if-conditions.

2017-03-06  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py(UncertaintyAwareDataArray.to):

	Bugfix, adapt signature for contexts to the one used by pint, such
	that it works when the number of contexts given is not exactly one.

2017-03-06  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py:

	Added `make_binary` and `make_directory_binary` to `__all__`.

	* (save): Added the new keyword `parents`.

	If `parents` is `True` missing parent directories are created.

	* (load_directory): Include zipped XML files to pattern.

	* (make_binary, make_directory_binary):

	Use the newly implemented `parents` keyword of `save` to create missing
	parent directories when needed.

	Both functions return the path(s) to the created file(s) to determine where
	the binary files are located.

	* doc/typhon.arts.rst: Added `make_binary` and `make_directory_binary`.

	* typhon/constants.py, typhon/physics/units/constants.py:

	Fixed typo in docstrings.

	* KNOWN_ISSUES: Removed solved issues.

2017-03-03  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py(express_uncertainty):

	- Tell user in machine form what args have failed to be
	differentiated.

	* typhon/physics/units/common.py:

	- Added some clarifying (hopefully) comments

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py:

	(UnitsAwareDataArray):

	- Support ufuncs that return floats rather than quantities.  Store
	as string so that it can be valid NetCDF.

	- Add support for __radd__, __rsub__, __rtruediv__, etc.

2017-03-03  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py:  Added helpers for SpeciesAuxData.
	These make use of property and setter keywords.  Makes version
	1 SpecisAuxData particularly much more user friendly but version
	2 SpecisAuxData is still a bit of a hassle.  (Isotopologue ratios
	are kept in version 1 data so it is now much easier to rescale
	your jacobian to give proper mixing ratios for different 
	Isotopologues.  Just load the isotop_ratio data and then access
	the isotopologue using dictionary operator[].  If you want to
	update the dictionary position, the @data.setter keywords automatically 
	aligns this with how the reading/writing routines work.)
	
	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py:  Added helpers for making many 
	files binary (e.g., for common folders in arts-xml-data)
	
2017-03-02  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/constants.py:

	Use sans-serif font for physical units in documentation.

2017-03-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* doc/_templates/layout.html, doc/_static/theme.css:

	Add css file to overwrite theme settings.

	Instead of red, use default font color for literals in text.

2017-03-01  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/physics/units/constants.py:

	Removed documentation entry for Kelvin-Celsius-conversion as it is not used
	when converting values with `pint`.

2017-03-01  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/constants.py, typhon/physics/units/constants.py:

	Added documentation for all defined constants.

	Removed deprecated constants R_d, R_w, M_d and M_w.

2017-02-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* Completely restructured the documentation layout. Having all
	functions/classes of a package documented on a single page made it
	very difficult to get a decent overview.

	Now, a list of functions and classes with short descriptions is
	generated for each package.

	See http://www.radiativetransfer.org/misc/typhon/doc-trunk

	Unfortunately, due to current limitations in Sphinx, it is not possible
	to generate these lists completely automatically.
	Therefore, when you add a function or class, you need to add its name
	manually to the corresponding rst file in the doc/ folder.

	Note that only top-level packages have their own rst file. Sub-packages
	are listed in the rst file of their parent package. (Only exception
	currently is plot.cm since plot and plot.cm contain many examples)

	* doc/typhon.arts.xml.rst: Merged into typhon.arts.

	* doc/conf.py:

	Link to Python 3.5 docs, not the dev version.

	Add autosummary extension.

	* doc/typhon.*.rst:

	Restructured by using the autosummary extensions.

	Added a list of all public functions and classes for each package.

	* typhon/geodesy/__init__.py:

	Cleanup short function descriptions.

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py, typhon/files/__init__.py:

	Move module description from rst file to py file.

	* doc/Makefile:

	Remove generated dir on clean.

	Add devupload target.

	* doc/developer.rst: Add note on adding functions/classes to docs.

	* doc/modules.rst:

	Reduces toc depth to 2. Remove arts.xml.

	Renamed API documentation to Reference.

	* doc/_templates/autosummary/base.rst,
	doc/_templates/autosummary/class.rst:

	Adapted autosummary templates for our needs.

2017-02-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2017-02-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: 0.3.6 Release.

2017-02-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py (SRF): Small fixes in examples.

	- Clarify how to use pint directly.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	- Small bugfixes

	* typhon/physics/units/tools.py: Added

	- Contains a unit-aware subclass of xarray.DataArray.  Still
	incomplete.


2017-02-27  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/units/{em,common}.py:

	- Add context to convert radiances to brightness temperatures (passing
	the SRF) within pints unit framework directly, and vice-versa.

2017-02-27  Gerrit Holl  <g.holL@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py(SRF):

	- Added examples to documentation
	- Made passing units and ndarrays optional, can now pass unitless or
	regular python numbers.

2017-02-27  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/units/common.py:

	- Add kayser/wavenumber to spectroscopy context for use in pint<0.8

2017-02-21  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/common.py(promote_maximally):

	- Clarify documentation and tolerate passing in plain Python numbers
	(for which it will do nothing).

2017-02-21  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py:

	Added `path_append`, `path_prepend` and `path_remove` to conveniently
	modify colon-separated path variables (e.g. PATH or ARTS_DATA_PATH).

2017-02-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* doc/*.rst: Use full module names for rst files.

2017-02-19  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/common.py (run_arts):

	Raise proper `FileNotFoundError` instead of an unspecific `Exception` if
	controfile is not found.

2017-02-18  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	(__eq__): Consider `dataname` when comparing GriddedField objects.

	(to_dict): If defined, use `dataname` as key for the data array.

2017-02-17  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py:
	
	(express_uncertainty): Add permissive mode where a single failed
	derivative does not cause the entire expression to fail (awaiting a
	fix for the failures).

	(recursive_args): Bugfix, was dropping indexed values completely
	rather than merely not descending into their index and indexbase.


2017-02-16  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/units/em.py(SRF):

	- Added method for estimating band coefficients for approximative
	conversions.  Not implemented yet, just put the documentation there.

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py(recursive_args):

	- Don't (by default) consider the integrand as an argument, at least
	not until I know how to propagate those through; will not happen for β
	FCDR.

2017-02-16  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py (load_indexed):

	Fixed documentation format.

2017-02-16  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py (load_indexed):

	Fixed handling of zero-padding in filenames.

2017-02-15  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	Fixed class method `to_atmlab_dict` to use the new `dataname` attribute.

2017-02-15  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py:

	(load):

	If the given file is not found, try to add the '.gz' extension.  This is
	consistent with ARTS.

	(load_indexed):

	Added a convenience function to load indexed XML files. All files matching
	a given filename pattern are loaded and the results are retunred in a list.

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	Added attribute `dataname` to all GriddedField classes. It is now possible
	to set a proper name for the stored data array.

	If `dataname` is not set, no name is written to XML files. This replaces
	the old behavior of adding 'Data' as default.

2017-02-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/arts/scattering.py (SingleScatteringData):

	Add support for version 3. Version 2 data is automatically upgraded to
	version 3 for non-azimuthally random particles.

2017-02-08  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/colors.py:

	All functions that export colormaps to files are now using the number of
	colors actually defined in the colormap as default.

	Changed the keyword argument in `mpl_colors()` from `n` to `N` for
	consistency.`

2017-02-03  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/physics/em.py:

	Added `radiance2planckTb()` and `radianc2rayleighjeansTb()` to convert
	radiances to brightness temperatures.

	* typhon/physics/tests/test_physics.py:

	Implemented tests for new functions.

2017-02-02  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(DatasetDeque.reset):

	- Reset either to start of time or to new time.

2017-01-30  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* setup.py:

	- Add support for Python 3.6 in addition to Python 3.5
	- Add dependency on xarray (≥ 0.8, apparently the version in conda)

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Uncomment scale_factor 1, was causing ints to become floats upon
	unpacking
	- Rename dimension “scanline” to “time” for more consistent processing

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	- Rename here too

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(DatasetDeque):

	- New class to aid moving through a large dataset in a deque-like
	way, i.e. when you read additional data at the tail, correspondingly
	time period of data gets removed at the head.

2017-01-27  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Move definition of how to encode HIRS in xarray Dataset to the
	definitions module.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.as_xarray_dataset):

	- Make more flexible, can skip dimensions so we can use it with
	collocations, for example.  Set encoding values for efficient storage
	in NetCDF4.  Improved documentation.

	* typhon/physics/units/common.py:

	- Fixed bug that caused radiance_units["ir"] to be a Quantity with
	magnitude 1, rather than a Unit.

2017-01-26  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py(express_uncertainty):

	- bugfix, don't stop at Function because an expression is also a
	Function so it will stop immediately, oops.  Also make sure we return
	immediately if passed a symbol or indexed.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.as_xarray_dataset):

	- New method that converts to an xarray dataset.  Still work in
	progress but appears to work sometimes.  Makes it very easy to write
	to NetCDF4.

2017-01-23  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Small bugfixes

2017-01-23  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS):

	- Started implementing improved overlap choice.  Work in progress.

2017-01-23  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/stats.py(corrcoef):

	- Calculate corrcoef with p-values.  Taken from StackOverflow,
	attribution in source code.

2017-01-23  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py:
	
	- We don't want uncertainties expressed in the free symbols if some
	symbols are arrays; rather, each element of the array needs to have
	its own uncertainty expression.  This is particularly important if
	different elements of an array have different units, such as may be
	the case when the coefficients of a polynomial are represented as an
	array.  Added a helper function to use for this.

2017-01-20  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/metrology.py:

	Started module with metrological functions.  Has soft dependency on
	sympy.

2017-01-16  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	Fixed __eq__() to work with empty GriddedField objects (cases where gf.data
	and gf.grids are None).

	* typhon/arts/tests/test_griddedfield.py:

	Added an equality test for empty GriddedFields.

2017-01-16  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/colors.py:

	Added new function colors2cmap() to convert a given list of colors (named
	color, rgb or hex) into a LinearSegmentedColormap.

7-01-10  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

201	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS):

	(._read):

	- Throw out anyone who doesn't want to stand in line nicely

7-01-10  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	(Dataset.read):

	- Don't fail on verifying time sorting if our array is too short to do
	so

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS):

	(._read):

	- Throw out scanlines where the time is bad.  Masking is not enough;
	time series processing tools such as xarray assume sequential time so
	enforcing this makes life muc heasier later on

	(.filter_firstline):

	- Change message from debug to warning if GFL DB cannot be read.

	(.apply_flags):

	- Flag times when qidonotuse is set, but do so if and only if the time
	at that point is inconsistent with either the preceding or the
	following scanline.  This gets rid of some (perhaps most?) instances
	where there are outliers in the time axis.

2017-01-09  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read):

	- Bugfix: do not crash if first granule empty or rejected.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.filter_firstline):

	- Don't make a copy, just read into memory already.  Certainly don't
	make a copy every time, this is a dramatic slowdown.

2017-01-09  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read):

	- when sorted data are requested, verify that granule N starts after
	granule N-1 finishes.  If this is not the case, raise an error.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS.filter_firstline):

	- When firstline db is locked, make a temporary copy and try again to
	read.

2017-01-06  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS):

	(.filter_firstlines) (.update_firstline_db):

	- Fix bug where I used the index in the file to create the firstline
	db, but the hrs_scnlin field to apply it.  This lead to errors in
	cases where there are gaps in hrs_scnlin in the early part of the
	file, and thus to folds in the time field and remaining duplicate
	lines.

2016-12-19  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Fix creation of array with [masked], shutting up UserWarning

	* typhon/datasets/model.py(ERAInterim):

	- bugfix, needs section attribute as well nowadays

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS):

	- update to modern progressbar usage, shutting up warning

	- use self.n_perline instead of hardcoded 56

	* typhon/math/array.py(mad_outliers):

	- don't fail when all are masked already

2016-12-14  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(HIRS): Add new attribute temperature_fields that lists all
	temperatures that can be requested, and populate with temperatures
	available in all HIRS.

	(HIRSKLM): Add temperature fields only available in KLM

	(HIRS4): Add temperature field only available in HIRS4

2016-12-14  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py(scatter_density_plot_matrix):

	- Permit to pass a regular 2-D array as well (but see warning in
	documentation).

2016-12-14  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py(scatter_density_plot_matrix):

	- Removed erroneous reference to hist2d, replaced by hexbin

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(HIRS.__init__):

	- Inform that hrs_scnlin is always needed

	(HIRS.read_period):

	- Suppress FutureWarning triggered by masked array module when
	selecting multiple fields from a structured masked array

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	(Dataset):

	- Add attribute `mandatory_fields`.  When populated, Dataset.read will
	ensure that those fields are always passed on to the low-level,
	instrument-specific reading routine.

	(Dataset.read_period):

	- On 29 November I added that ValueError should be caught here.  Undo
	this; it catches too many false positives.  Instead, ValueError should
	be caught at a lower level and then chained into a descendent of
	DataFileError.

2016-12-14  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/oem/__init__.py: Divided package content into submodules.

	Import modules common and error.

	* typhon/oem/common.py: General functions connected to OEM.

	Currently containing functions to calculate averaging kernels or error
	covariance matrices.

	* typhon/oem/error.py: Functions to estimate the retrieval error.

	Currenlty containing functions to estimate smoothing error and retrieval
	noise.

2016-12-13  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py(scatter_density_plot_matrix):

	- Allow alternate way of passing data to be plotted, i.e. as keyword
	arguments.  This should be nicer in Python 3.6+ as keyword argument
	order will be preserved.

	- Add some examples to documentation, either with structured array or
	with keyword arguments.

2016-12-12  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py(scatter_density_plot_matrix): 

	- Allow to pass units for x- and y-axes

	- Bugfix in range handling

	- Raise a warning if range is empty for a subplot

2016-12-12  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/plots/plots.py(scatter_density_plot_matrix): Added

	- Like a scatter plot matrix but with a
	hexbin+plot_distribution_as_percentiles in every off-diagonal.

2016-12-09  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read, Dataset._add_pseudo_fields):

	- Delegate addition of pseudo-fields to different method so that
	subclasses can implement specialised versions.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIRS._add_pseudo_fields):

	- Implement specialisation considering that HIRS._read might return a
	tuple (head, lines), which messes up the pre-checks before passing the
	result from HIRS._read on to functions calculating pseudo fields.

2016-12-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

	* CHANGES: Put back header for new changes.

2016-12-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py, CHANGES: 0.3.5 Release.

2016-12-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* Changes: Renamed to CHANGES.

2016-12-07  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/geodesy:
	
	Added (geometric_limb_zenith_angle) and (line_ellipsoid_intersect) as
	helper functions to get ellipsoid limb zenith  angles when other 
	satellite parameters are known.  The first is used to get the 
	geometric limb viewing zenith angle by using the intersection between
	a line and the ellipsoid of the second function.

2016-12-07  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/spectroscopy.py:

	Module for spectroscopy related functions. Currently containing a function
	to calculte the width (full-width at half maximum) of an absorption line.

	* typhon/__init__.py: Import spectroscopy.

	* doc/modules.rstm doc/spectroscopy.rst:

	Added spectroscopy to documentation.

2016-12-07  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* typhon/geodesy:
	
	Added (geocentricposlos2cart).

2016-11-30  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* Changes:

	Added information on GriddedField.copy() and the new constructor behaviour.

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	Implemented a copy() method to return a deepcopy of a GriddedField object.

	Attributes passed to the constructor are now copied to prevent references
	inside the new GriddedField object.

	Higher level constructors (e.g. GriddedField3) now take all positional and
	keyword arguments.

	* typhon/arts/tests/test_griddedfield.py:

	Added tests to check the deepcopying of GriddedFields.

2016-11-29  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(HIRS):

	- Fix regulary expression for HIRS.  Sometimes the second part is HIRX
	and sometimes it is HIRS.  I don't know why, but let's make sure we
	catch both.

	- Add satname as attribute, so that users can bypass passing it every
	time.

	(HIRS.update_firstline_db):

	- Make passing the satname optional, if we already pass it on object
	creation.

	(get_mask_from_flags):

	- Bugfix in setting flags per channel where counts/bt/radiance do not
	have the same dimension

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:
	
	(Dataset.read_period):

	- Also catch cases where reader triggers ValueError.

	(Dataset.read):

	- Change format of my_pseudo_fields.  Now, each value of this
	dictionary shall be a tuple of three, rather than two, elements,
	namely `(List[str], function, Mapping[str, Any])`.  The first element
	indicates the dependencies; the second the function to be called to
	calculate the pseudo_field, and the third (new) any conditions on
	keyword arguments passed to the reading routine based upon which this
	pseudo_field shall be called at all.  For example, for HIRS, we only
	want to calculate my_pseudo_fields if calibrate=True because the
	pseudo fields rely on the results of the calibration.

2016-11-29  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/tests/test_geographical.py:

	Removed check for floating point equality. Use np.allclose() to allow
	some tolerance.

2016-11-22  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/tests/test_griddedfield.py:

	Added test cases for new shape and subscription features.

2016-11-21  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	The GriddedField class now offers a ``shape`` property to directly return
	the shape of the underlying data array.

	GriddedFields are now subsriptable and return the values of the stored data
	array.

	* Changes:

	Added information on GriddedField changes as they provide a significant
	improvement in usability.

2016-11-18  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(HIRS4.get_mask_from_flags):

	- treat channel-specific flags for calibration failures.  Catches some
	but not all so doesn't solve the problem as far as FIDUCEO is
	concerened.

2016-11-18  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* Changes: Added a file to keep track of major changes between releases.

2016-11-17  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/common.py(calculate_precisely):

	- Add reference to old numpy bug that makes this necessary

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read):

	- Change syntax for my_pseudo_fields such that it can have
	dependencies on other fields and pseudo_fields, which are then read as
	well.

2016-11-15  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/common.py:

	(promote_maximally): Promote ndarrays to their maximal precision, i.e.
	ints to i8, floats to f8, etc.  Works for int, float, uint.  Designed
	to be used with calculate_precisely.

	(calculate_precisely): Wrapper to promote all ndarray arguments of a
	function to their maximal precision.  Useful when you are losing
	precision in your mathematical calculations and there is no
	straightforward way of preventing this by rewriting the algorithm.

2016-11-15  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read): Support either single- or
	double-argument pseudofield function

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(TOVSCollocatedDataset): New mixin class for any collocated dataset
	involving scanlines.

	(TOVSCollocatedDataset.combine): Make sure we use column information
	to select right column from exact matchup.

	(HIRSHIRS.combine): Pass right instructions to parent class.

2016-11-15  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/tests/test_matpack_types.py:

	Test the behaviour when reading and writing zipped XML files.

2016-11-15  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py:

	Fixed check for '.gz' file ending. Exception is thrown if one attends to
	save a zipped file in binary format.

	Use 'wt' mode when opening files to fix the writing of gzipped files.

2016-11-10  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:
	
	(HIRS):

	Make `satellites` attribute into a dictionary, to list all accepted
	forms for a particular satellite (NOAA08, noaa08, noaa8, n08, etc.).
	
	(which_hirs_fcdr):

	Relocate this function to FCDR_HIRS package.  It never even worked
	here!  See
	https://github.com/FIDUCEO/FCDR_HIRS/blob/master/FCDR_HIRS/fcdr.py

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read_period):

	Fix bug handling pseudo_fields for empty granules

2016-11-10  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/array.py(mad_outliers):

	- Implement outlier detection based on number of MADS from median,
	with a percentile-based mechanism if MAD=0

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	(Dataset): Add attributes 'section' and 'my_pseudo_fields'.  Section
	replaces name for looking up in .pyatmlabrc.  my_pseudo_fields is used
	to define object-wide on-the-fly-calculated fields.

	(Dataset.read): Add ability to have my_pseudo_fields attribute on
	dataset object.  This works like pseudo_fields the fields are passed
	as normal fields, but in reality calculated on-the-fly.

	(Dataset.verify_mandatory_fields): No need any more to pass on fields
	if those are already set as attributes.  For example, one can create a
	noaa12-specific HIRS2-object and will not need to pass satname to
	individual methods.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(HIRS) (IASIEPS) (IASISub) (HIRSHIRS) (MHS_L1C): Seperate attribute
	`section` from `name`.  This allows to create different HIRS objects
	corresponding to different satellites.

	(HIRS._convert_temp): Flag outlier temperatures using
	typhon.math.array.mad_outliers.

	(HIRS.extract_calibcount_and_temp) (HIRS.calculate_offset_and_slope):
	Move methods to a subclass at
	https://github.com/FIDUCEO/FCDR_HIRS/blob/master/FCDR_HIRS/fcdr.py as
	this is only relevant for the FIDUCEO FCDR creation.

	(HIRSHIRS):

	- Fix start_date and end_date

	(HIRSHIRS._read):

	- Add a time-field that has only one value per collocation

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py:

	- Add definitions for noaa14, noaa12, work in progress

2016-09-30  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/typhon/datasets (HIRS):

	- Add re to HIRS definition.  Include cases where it starts with
	a prefix of (L\d*) for some reason.

2016-09-30  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/__init__.py (run_arts):

	By default an exception is raised if the ARTS run failed. This behaviour
	can the disabled with the ignore_error keyword.

2016-09-28  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:
	
	(HIRS.calc_time_since_last_calib):

	- Fix bug introduced when reducing memory usage, now returns correct
	tsc in seconds (float) again, I hope.

	(HIRSHIRS._read)

	- Add time field, needs more checking though.

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:
	
	(Dataset.read_period):

	- Fix bug that was destroying flags by turning a masked array into a
	regular array.

	- Don't report success when no data were available.

	(NetCDFDataset._read):

	- Use masked arrays and respect fillvalues accordingly, if available.
	
2016-09-28  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py(plot_distribution_as_percentiles):

	- Bugfix: should omit label for repeated pattern for higher
	percentiles if no locallib is passed.

	* typhon/dataset/dataset.py:
	
	(Dataset.read_period):

	- Rather than gathering a list of ndarrays, dynamically guess the size
	of the final ndarray required and copy data into there directly.  This
	reduces memory consumption by at least a factor two.  Uses a maximum
	size, contained in the `maxsize` attribute, which causes it to refuse
	to even start reading years of data when the estimated size will be
	too large (it will give up at 10% at the moment).

	(Dataset.combine):

	- Allow fo other_data to be passed directly.  Also, support
	non-masked-arrays.

	(MultiFileDataset.iterate_subdirs):

	- Bugfix for the case where all granules are in the same directory (no
	sorting by year).

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:
	
	(HIRS.calc_time_since_last_calib):

	- Calculate time since last calibration cycle

	(HIRSHIRS):

	Added class for Brockmanns HIRSHIRS collocations.


2016-09-27  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/physics/__init__.py:

	Added documentation to all spectroscopic conversion functions.

	Conversion functions are now properly included in __all__.

2016-09-23  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon.plots.__init__.py(plot_distribution_as_percentiles):

	- Bugfix, correct keywoard is linestyle, not ls.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:

	(ATOVS):
	
	- Started this class to collect functionality in common between HIRS
	and other ATOVS readers.  Currently designed as a mixin but could also
	be designed as a subclass of MultiFileDataset.  Don't remember right
	now why that didn't work.

	(HIRS._read):

	- When filtering firstlines fails, catch the KeyError and instead
	raise a more useful InvalidFileError, so that the caller can more
	specifically catch this problem.

	(HIRSKLM.get_mask_from_flags):

	- For scanlines that don't observe Earth, mask not only BT but also
	radiance.

	(MHSL1C):

	- Class to read MHS L1C files in NetCDF, such as the ones converted by
	people in Hamburg (kudos to... Oliver?)

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(NetCDFDataset._read):

	- Do some evil trickery to convert some form of NetCDF file with
	groups to a structured array.  This is likely to be changed, the
	proper way would be with structured subdtypes.  Use with care!


2016-09-20  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py(HIASI.combine):

	- Overload method in this particular case, so that I pick out the
	correct one from each scanline.

2016-09-20  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.combine):

	Re-implemented combination algorithm, now runs in O(n) (I think)
	rather than O(n²).

2016-09-20  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/physics/units/thermodynamics.py:

	Added function to calculate Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.

	* typhon/physics/__init__.py: PEP8 fixes.

2016-09-20  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py:

	Added function to return all available mplstyles.

	* doc/pyplots/stylesheet_gallery.py:

	Use newly implemented function to loop over all styles.

2016-09-19  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.combine):

	- Duh, time difference should be SMALLER than tolerance, not larger!

2016-09-19  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/math/stats.py(get_distribution_as_percentiles):

	- Explicitly get rid of masked arrays — scoreatpercentile otherwise
	will return incorrect results.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py:
	
	(HIRS.get_temp) (HIRSPOD.get_temp):

	- Bugfix, wrong size for patch_exp, fsr

	(HIASI): New class for Vijus HIRS-IASI collocations

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	(Dataset.combine):

	- Expand for situation where self and other do not have the same name
	for things.

	- Allow explicit tolerance for datetime64 options; does not support
	isclose but anyway might want larger tolerance.

	(MultiFileDataset.find_granules):

	- Be more verbose when stuff isn't found.

	(NetCDFDataset):

	- New class for products in NetCDF, tries to cleverly read NetCDF
	dataset into structured ndarray.
	
2016-09-19  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/modules.rst: Removed thermodynamics.

	* doc/physics.rst: Added new subpackages for physics.

	New module to implement wrappers for functions in
	typhon.physics.thermodynamics.

2016-09-19  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Removed import of thermodynamics.

	* typhon/atmosphere.py: Fixed import of thermodynamics.

	* typhon/physics/__init__.py: Import thermodynamics. Do not import units.

	* typhon/physics/em.py: Moved to typhon/physics/units/em.py.

	* typhon/physics/units: New sub-package for calculations with units.

	* typhon/physics/units/__init__.py: New file.

	* typhon/physics/units/common.py: Common UnitRegisrty definitions.

	* typhon/thermodynamics.py: Moved to typhon/physics/thermodynamics.py:

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Fixed import of em.

	* typhon/plots/tests/test_mplstyles.py:

	Replaced outdated test of install_mplstyles().

2016-09-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/math/stats.py (adev): Fix formula formatting and parameters.

2016-09-19  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py: Removed install_mplstyles().

	The function install_mplstyles() has been replaced by styles().
	The new implementation returns the absolute path to a given stylesheet
	instead of creating a symlink in the user's matplotlib config directory.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	The property cycler no longer cycles through linewidths. It is a bit too
	unintuitive to cycle all three line properties at once. If you want to
	restore the old behaviour you can use the 'typhon-fullcycler' style.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon-fullcycler.mplstyle:

	Restore the old porperty cycler for color, linestyle and linewidth.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon-geometry.mplstyle:

	Set the figures geometry (figure size, font sizes, ...) but use the default
	colors and colormaps.

	* ChangeLog: Not commited the last time...

	* doc/pyplots/plot_vorticity.py: Removed unused import.

	* doc/pyplots/stylesheet_gallery.py:

	Adapted for the new way of style handling.

2016-09-16  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/geodesy/__init__.py, typhon/physics/__init__.py:

	Add docs for types of input arguments and return values.

	* typhon/geodesy/__init__.py:

	Convert to unix line endings.

	Remove unused scimath import.

	(geographic_mean): Add altitude with default 0.

2016-09-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/geodesy/__init__.py, typhon/physics/__init__.py:

	Remove __credits__ variables as they show up in editors with syntax
	checking as unused variables. Instead add a line to the docstring as a
	hidden Sphinx comment noting that the function originates from atmlab
	and state the original author.

	* typhon/arts/xml/write.py:

	(ARTSXMLWriter.write_basic_type): Set default value of attr to None.

	(ARTSXMLWriter.write_header): Remove obsolete arg from docs.

	(ARTSXMLWriter.write): Don't use str as a parameter name.

	(ARTSXMLWriter.write_ndarray): Remove redundant parenthesis.

2016-09-15  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/physics/__init__.py:

	Ported Fresnel and Snell functions from atmlab.

2016-09-15  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py: Reimplemented Sparse class.

	The Sparse class is now a simple wrapper around SciPy's csc_matrix.

	The usage of both classes is exactly the same, the only differences are
	additional reading and writing functions for XML files as well as
	ARTS-consistent attributenames.

	Changes are **not** backwards compatible! Code relying on the old
	implementation of Sparse will fail and has to be adapted.

2016-09-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2016-09-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: 0.3.2 Release.

2016-09-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Revert (presumably accidental) change of default font size and
	linewidth to huge values.

2016-09-12  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/constants.py: Fixed attribute names for consistency.

2016-09-12  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/constants.py:

	Molar masses for dry air and water vapor are now listed in SI units.

	Old definitions from Wallace and Hobbs are deprecated and will be removed
	in a future version!

	Gas constants for dry air and water vapor are calculated on the fly
	using the previously defined gas constant and molar masses.

	Added Earth characteristics.

	Add docs for types of input arguments and return values.

2016-09-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/cm/__init__.py: Rename cmap to cm in module scope loop. Avoids
	warnings about it being shadowed when the name cmap is used as function
	argument name in other functions.

	(mpl_colors): Make n argument lowercase.

	* typhon/cm/_cmocean.py, typhon/cm/_cm.py:

	Initialize datad as dictionary literal.

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py (Timer):

	Fix typo in docs r -> t.

	* typhon/utils/latex.py: Add import numpy to docs.

	* typhon/utils/metaclass.py:

	Rename first argument to __new__ from meta to mcs to adhere to python
	naming conventions. Analog to using cls in class methods.

2016-09-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py:

	(figsize): Fix doc that was still referencing to cm module. Add
	import statements to docs to enable better consistency checking.

	(plot_distribution_as_percentiles): Make d_ls lowercase. Initialize
	locallab early to avoid it being possibly used uninitialized.

	(install_mplstyles): Add import statements to docs.
	Add import for matplotlib.style. reload_libary was unknown.

2016-09-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/arts/__init__.py:

	Import GriddedField4.

	(run_arts): Change variable arts_out to lowercase.

	Change reportlevel in example to string. 020 cannot be passed as a
	number. In old python versions it would be interpreted as an octal
	number(not what we want). In Python 3.5 it's a syntax error.

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py:

	Obey max line length.

	Remove unnecessary parenthesis after class names.

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	Move all property documentation into getter.

	(SingleScatteringData.to_atmlab_dict,
	ScatteringMetaData.to_atmlab_dict): Use dict literal for initialization.

	(SingleScatteringData.__init__): Initialize known attributes with None.

2016-09-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py:

	(SpeciesAuxData.from_xml): Raise exception if version is unknown.

	(Sparse.from_csc_matrix): Small doc fix.

2016-09-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/arts/catalogues.py, typhon/arts/catalogues.py:

	Autopep8.

	Remove unnecessary imports (griddedfield.* and numbers).

	Use 'if isinstance() ...' instead of 'if type() is ...' because
	isinstance also takes into account inheritance.

	* typhon/arts/retrieval.py: Remove unnecessary import numpy.

	* typhon/arts/scattering.py, typhon/arts/utils.py:

	Use 'if isinstance() ...' instead of 'if type() is ...'.

	* doc/cm.rst: Added example plot for vorticity colormap.

	* doc/pyplots/plot_vorticity.py: Create example for vorticity colormap.

	Plotting test data to give an example for the vorticity colormap.

	* doc/pyplots/plot_velocity.py: Fixed docstring.

2016-07-20  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/cm.rst: Added example plot for velocity colormap.

	* doc/pyplots/plot_velocity.py: Create example for velocity colormap.

	Plotting the meridional wind to give an example for the velocity colormap.

2016-07-15  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py: Added safe_eval

	Added safe_eval function, from where it is somewhat safe to pass eval
	code from a not entirely trusted source.  Supports numbers and basic
	expressions.

	* typhon/datasets/tovs.py: Added classes related to HIRS and IASI

	Added a hierarchy of classes for reading HIRS and IASI data.  This
	module has a soft dependency on pint.

	* typhon/datasets/_tovs_defs.py: Definitions needed by tovs module.

	* doc/datasets.rst: Add tovs module (but not _tovs_defs).

2016-07-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/physics/__init__.py: s/unit/units/ in __all__.

2016-07-15  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/physics/__init__.py: Added package

	* typhon/physics/constants.py: Added module with physical constants.

	* typhon/physics/units.py: Added module handling units.

	Note that this module has a soft dependency on the `pint` units
	library.  Any module importing physics.units will also have this
	dependency.  If you do not want your code to depend on the `pint`
	units library, do not import `physics.units` or any of its
	dependencies.  Any module with this dependency shall state so in the
	module docstring.

	* typhon/physics/em.py: Module with EM-related classes and functions.

	Added class SRF for the description of spectral response functions and
	the calculation thereof.

	Added various smaller functions for EM-related conversions.

	* doc/physics.rst: Added

	* doc/modules.rst: Added physics package and modules.

2016-07-14  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/conf.py: Set highlight_Language to python3.

	* doc/oem.rst: Uncomment automodule for typhon.oem.

	Included decent documentation for the OEM module. By setting the
	highlight_language to python3 it is possible to display the matrix operator
	(@) in the documentation.

2016-06-29  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/stats.py:

	- Add function to calculate Allan Devation

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	- Make figure title (suptitle) size consistent with axes title size.

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	- Fix bug related to boundary cases when ensuring last data from
	previou granule also read.

2016-06-22  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/developer.rst: Fixed broken link to Google Python Style Guide.

	* doc/pyplots/_data/test_data.nc: Increased resolution of test data.

2016-06-15  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/array.py:

	- Added function that calculates the bit parity of all integers in an
	array.  This is used in the HIRS reading routine that I will be adding
	at some point.

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	- Bugfix when instant is near the end of a day/month/year

2016-06-13  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read_period):

	- Actually read all measurements in period, including those contained
	in a granule starting before the starting time.  Do not return
	measurements beyond the end of the indicated period.

2016-06-10  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Use the logging module to warn when no
	directories are found.  Inherit InvalidDataError from ValueError.
		
2016-06-03  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Added capability to skip the first
	several lines of a granule, if they are contained in the previous one.
	Note that this is not always the correct method; sometimes the quality
	of either one is better.  Ideally, what granule to take a scanline
	from should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.

2016-05-23  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py:

	Added class to provide a simple time profiling utility.

2016-05-20  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>:

	* typhon/utils/cache.py: Bugfix

	- Now I realise why functools.lru_cache refuses to cache mutable
	results... duh!  The mutable result gets altered earlier or later, so
	it's not an actual cache of the object.  As a workaround (I still want
	to cache it!) I'm caching a copy.

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Bugfix

	- Something was going disastrously wrong in find_granules_sorted.  It
	doesn't seem to go nearly as disastrously wrong now.  It might even be
	miraculously correct.

2016-05-20  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Changed default mathtext font.

2016-05-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2016-05-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	Added function extract_block_diag() to extract blocks around the
	diagonal of a square matrix.

2016-05-11  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py:

	Added keyword argument 'comment' to save() function. A string passed as
	comment is included within a comment tag at the top of the XML file.

	* typhon/arts/xml/write.py:

	Implemented function write_comment() to write strings into a comment tag.

2016-05-11  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/xml/read.py: Fixed the handling of comments.

	Comment tags are now handled properly. If a XML file contains a comment
	only None is returned. Comments within a file storing actual data are
	ignored.

	* typhon/arts/xml/tests/test_matpack_types.py:

	Added two test cases to check the handling of comments in XML files.

	* typhon/arts/xml/tests/reference/arrayofindex-comment.xml:

	ArrayOfIndex with additional comment tag.

	* typhon/arts/xml/tests/reference/comment.xml: Only a comment tag.

2016-05-11  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/_static/increased_width.css: CSS style with increased maxwidth.

	The maximum width for the documentation is increased to prevent plots
	using the typhon style from being scaled.

	* doc/_templates/layout.html:

	Use added CSS style for the default documentation layout.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Switched yellow and cyan in colorcycle. This way blue hues do not follow
	each other when the cycle starts over again.

2016-05-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2016-05-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	Show source and generated plots of stylesheet_gallery.py

	* doc/pyplots/stylesheet_gallery.py:

	Generate example plots using the classic style and all styles shipped
	with typhon.

2016-05-03  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Improved the overall look of the typhon style sheet. Changes include grid
	settings, adjusted linewidths and fine tuned scientific notation limits.

2016-05-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py, typhon/arts/scattering.py:

	Added convenience method to_atmlab_dict to GriddedField,
	ScatteringMetaData and SingleScatteringData.

2016-05-02  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py: Import matplotlib.style

	* typhon/plots/tests: Tests for the plots package.

	* typhon/plots/tests/test_mplstyles.py:

	Module to provide test functions. Currently containing
	test_install_mplstyle() to check if all mplstyles get installed.

2016-05-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: 0.2.15 Release.

	* MANIFEST.in: Add xml.bin test files.

2016-05-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add mplstyle and xml test files.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: 0.2.12 Release.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py, setup.py:

	Previous fix didn't work. Of course an import of typhon.version also
	imports typhon/__init__.py. *duh*

	Next try: Add a flag __TYPHON_SETUP__ to builtins in setup.py and set
	it to True. This way __init__.py can determine if it is imported
	normally or during setup process. During setup, only __version__ is
	provided and all other imports are omitted.

	* typhon/version.py: Use 'dev' instead of 'unknown'.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

	* ChangeLog: Corrections to previous entries.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/version.py: 0.2.11 Release.

	* doc/conf.py: Update copyright year.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py, typhon/version.py:

	Seperate version handling from __init_.py. Otherwise we need to import
	typhon/__init__.py into setup.py. This shouldn't be done as it makes
	setup.py dependent on all external packages imported by __init__.py.
	Anaconda skeleton pypi build hopefully works again now.

	* typhon/version.py:

	Don't fail completely if there is a problem determining the svn
	revision number. Just set it to 'unknown' in that case.

	* setup.py: Import typhon.version instead of typhon.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2016-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: 0.2.10 Release.

2016-04-28  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* ChangeLog: Fixed typo.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle: Fixed syntax error.

2016-04-28  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* KNOWN_ISSUES:

	prop_cycle through linestyles and linewidths breaks the usage of
	keyword aliases in matplotlib functions.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Added TODO comment on prop_cycle issue.

2016-04-27  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py:

	Added examples to install_mplstyles() docstring.

2016-04-27  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Increased linewidths in propcycle by 1 as the smallest should be 2.

	2016-04-27  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Automatically change linestyle after cycling through all available colors.
	This extends the number of different styles to 18 (6 colors, 3 linestyles).
	The linewidth for dashed and dotted lines is increased to adjust their look
	in comparison to solid lines.

2016-04-22  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py:

	install_mplstyles() overwrites symlinks and automatically reloads the
	stylesheet library.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Replace the default colorcycle with more muted colors.

2016-04-21  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py:

	Added install_mplstyles() to create symbolic links for matplotlib
	stylesheets shipped with typhon.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib: Directory to store matplotlib stylesheets.

	* typhon/plots/stylelib/typhon.mplstyle:

	Matplotlib stylesheet to overwrite the default values for rc params.

2016-04-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* setup.py: Remove author_email. Update homepage url.

2016-04-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Set DEVBUILD back to True after release.

2016-04-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: 0.2.9 Release.

2016-04-05  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py:

	Added examples on how to create and use a GriddedField object.

2016-03-24  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	- Try to show a progressbar to show the progress on reading a large
	amount of data.  Only works when the progressbar module is available —
	see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2

	- Fig bug when no fields are mandatory.

2016-03-22  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	- Raise a specific exception with a helpful error message if mandatory
	fields are missing or have invalid values.

2016-03-22  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	- Don't require name, fallback to attribute then to class name.

2016-03-21  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/utils/metaclass.py:

	- When inheriting a docstring, state what class the docstring was
	inherited from.

2016-03-18  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py(Dataset.read_period):

	- Add filtering ability to reading long period.

2016-03-18  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/array.py(limit_ndarray):

	- New function to select elements from structured ndarray based on
	ranges.  Inspired by a similar function in atmlab.

2016-03-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Improve revision regex.

2016-03-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py:

	Improved version number handling. The svn revision number was not
	correctly updated (reported by Gerrit).
	The current svn revision is now extracted from 'svn info' for
	development versions and appended to the installed package version.
	However, because the svn version cannot be determined for installed
	packages, typhon.__version__ has the string '+dev' appended for
	development versions.

	This also changes the convention for version number increases. The
	version number is now increased before release, not after.

2016-03-17  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py:

	(Dataset): Make Dataset class semi-singleton.  For a particular class, there
	should be only one object with the same name.  If one attempts to
	create one with an already-existing name, the existing object is
	returned.

	(Dataset.read_period): Add provision to pass on arguments to
	find_granules and to the reader.
	
	
2016-03-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	Remove some unnecessary headings.

2016-03-09  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/math/array.py: Added

	Collection of math-related functions that are uniquely for array, such
	as reduction operators.  Added one function, 'localmin', that returns
	a mask with True at the locations where a 1-D array has a local
	minimum.

	* typhon/math/__init__.py: Added stats, array

	* doc/modules.rst: Added math

2016-03-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* setup.py:

	Remove python 3.4 from supported languages because we now use the new @
	matrix operator from python 3.5.

2016-03-08  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* KNOWN_ISSUES: Added info about failing sphinx build for oem module.

	* doc/oem.rst:

	Added disclaimer that the documentation is currently not working.

	* doc/plots.rst: Fixed heading syntax.

2016-03-07  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* doc/modules.rst: Added new module oem.

	* doc/oem.rst: Documentation for oem module.

	The autogeneration of function documentation is currently not working.
	Sphinx seems to have trouble interpreting the @ operator for highlighted
	code blocks.

	* typhon/__init__.py: Import oem module by default.

	* typhon/oem:

	New module to provide functions related to the Optimal Estimation Method.

	* typhon/oem/__init__.py:

	Currently containing functions to calculate the error covariance matrix as
	well as the averaging kernel matrix.

2016-03-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py:

	Fix runtime error when calling _runtest() from jupyter qtconsole and
	notebook. Bug reported by Lukas.

2016-03-03  Gerrit Holl	<g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/plots/__init__.py:

	Added function to plot y vs. x as a set of percentiles, essentially
	plotting the distribution over time.

	* typhon/math/stats.py: Added

	Added module with statisticas functions.  Currently contains two
	binning utilities moved over from pyatmlab: one for 1-D binning, and
	one for n-D binning.  They are functionally identical to their
	counterparts in atmlab.

	* typhon/math/__init__.py: Added

	Package to contain various maths-related modules.

2016-03-03  Gerrit Holl <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>

	* typhon/utils/cache.py: Added missing 'import logging'

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Numerous bugfixes

2016-03-01  Lukas Kluft <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* environment.yml: Removed typhon after discussion with Oliver.

	`pip install -e` should be the default way, so there is no need for
	typhon being a dependency in environment.yml

2016-03-01  Lukas Kluft <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* environment.yml: Added typhon to list of dependencies.

	typhon is now automatically installed when using environment.yml with conda.
	It is still possible to overwrite this version with a local development
	version using `pip install -e`.

2016-02-29  Lukas Kluft <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/arts/griddedfield.py: Replaced loop with dict comprehension.

2016-02-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Close the door, a tab snuck in.

2016-02-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py:

	Add revision to version number for development releases.

2016-02-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/datasets/__init__.py: Fix typo in import.

2016-02-25  Gerrit Holl  <g.holl@reading.ac.uk>
	
	* typhon/utils/metaclass.py: Added

	New module to collect typhon-related metaclasses.  Added two
	metaclasses:

	- DocStringInheritor.  When a class with this metaclass has a method
	overridden, and the subclass method omits any docstring, it will
	automatically inherit the docstring from the superclass.

	- AbstractDocStringInheritor: the same, but for abstract classes.

	Those metaclasses are used by my dataset and collocation frameworks.

	* typhon/utils/cache.py: Added

	New module collecting functions related to caching.  Python comes with
	functools.lru_cache but this doesn't do mutable objects.  That's for a
	good reason, but I want to cache mutable objects anyway!  Use at your
	own risk.

	For disk-stored memoisation, I like to use joblib, but this is not
	currently a typhon dependency.

	* typhon/utils/__init__.py: Also import new modules I added

	* typhon/datasets/__init__.py: Added.  Import sole module.

	* typhon/datasets/dataset.py: Added

	New module containing classes for a framework abstracting datasets.

	Currently contains classes Dataset, SingleFileDataset,
	MultiFileDataset, SingleMeasurementPerFileDataset, and
	HomemadeDataset.

	Those are abstract classes, designed to be subclassed by classes
	implementing routines for specific datasets.  I will soon add some
	specific dataset classes to typhon.

	It is possible that some parts of this module rely on numpy bugfixes
	that are only available from numpy 1.11, which is not released yet, as
	the latest version today is 1.11.0rc1.  This might particularly be the
	case for structured masked multidimensional arrays.
	
	* typhon/config.py: Added

	New module to handle configuration.  Configuration shall be used to
	describe such things as where datasets are located, thus separating
	description from implementation.

	* doc/datasets.rst: Added

	* doc/modules.rst: Updated

	* doc/utils.rst: Updated

2016-02-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* doc/cm.rst: Added a second example plot for Phase colormap.

	* doc/pyplots/plot_phase_sinus.py:

	New example plot to demonstrate the Phase colormap using sinus functions.

	* doc/pyplots/plot_qualitative1.py, doc/pyplots/plot_qualitative2.py:

	The figure size is now calculated using typhon.cm.figsize.

	* typhon/arts/xml/__init__.py (load): Added example to docstring.

	* typhon/cm/__init__.py (figsize):

	Added function to construct figure sizes matching the golden ration.

2016-02-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Post-upload version bump to 0.2.6.

2016-02-18  Lukas Kluft <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Do not import cm automatically.

	The colormap module has to be imported directly using 'import typhon.cm'.

	* doc/pyplots/plot_density.py doc/pyplots/plot_phase.py
	doc/pyplots/plot_qualitative1.py doc/pyplots/plot_qualitative2.py
	doc/pyplots/plot_speed.py doc/pyplots/plot_temperature.py:

	Added the direct import of typhon.cm to the example plots.

2016-02-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* typhon/__init__.py: Post-upload version bump to 0.2.5.

2016-02-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* ChangeLog: Got lost in previous commit.

	* setup.py:

	Change status from Planning to Alpha.

	Remove Python 3.3 compatibility.

2016-02-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* doc/requirements.rtd: Removed again. The automatic build
	of the documentation through the readthedocs.org service fails if
	additional packages such as netCDF4 are required. Although packages can
	be set as requirements for the build, the pip install in their
	virtualenv fails in this case due to lack of HDF5. Similar problems
	will most likely occur later for other packages (e.g. basemap).

	This makes the readthedocs service useless for our purposes. The typhon
	docs have moved with immediate effect to

	http://www.radiativetransfer.org/misc/typhon/doc/

	instead. That gives us much more flexibility. The rtd project has been
	removed.
