HISTORY
=======

1.0 - BugFixes
--------------

* Corrected classes when calculating binning as table because RFC classes always start counting on 1 .. max_bin, no negative classes anymore

0.9 - BugFixes and Tests
------------------------

* BugFixes on counting pairs
* Tests for core functions

0.8 - BugFixes
--------------

* BugFixes to reduce differences between table and matrix of counted pairs

0.7 - Remove small cycles option
--------------------------------

* During normal rainflow cycles like 1 to 1 can not exist, but with the classification afterwards small cycles will lead to such pairs. They will be removed now


0.6 - Add Axis to matrix
------------------------

* You can store axis to matrix if you want using parameter axis

0.5 - BugFixes
--------------

* Fixed Bug on filtering data with pairs

0.4 - Added Matrix-calculation
-------------------------------

* User can decide between matrix and table format for classification
* Added examples for both
* BugFix in count-method
* Style improvements
* Filter outliers in binning

0.2 - Syntax Improvement
------------------------

* Better documentation
* Improved parameters of functions

0.1 - Initial release
---------------------

* Rainflow for HDF5 and Numpy-Arrays
* Classification before and after algorithm
* Removing peaks from data before calculation
