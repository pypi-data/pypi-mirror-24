        ======
        
        This package provides a cython optimized rainflow algorithm. Data can be
        provided as hdf5-table or as numpy array.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        For installing this package just run the setup.py.
        
        Requirements:
        * numpy
        * tables
        * pandas
        * cython
        * numexpr
        
        Or use the pypi-package and install it via pip.
        
            pip install inqbus.rainflow
        
        Examples and Usage
        ------------------
        
        There are examples included in
        inqbus.rainflow/src/inqbus/rainflow/examples
        
        The main mehtods are located and described in
        inqbus.rainflow/src/inqbus/rainflow/run_rainflow
        
        
        HISTORY
        =======
        
        1.0 - BugFixes
        --------------
        
        * Corrected classes when calculating binning as table because RFC classes always start counting on 1 .. max_bin, no negative classes anymore
        
        0.9 - BugFixes and Tests
        ------------------------
        
        * BugFixes on counting pairs
        * Tests for core functions
        
        0.8 - BugFixes
        --------------
        
        * BugFixes to reduce differences between table and matrix of counted pairs
        
        0.7 - Remove small cycles option
        --------------------------------
        
        * During normal rainflow cycles like 1 to 1 can not exist, but with the classification afterwards small cycles will lead to such pairs. They will be removed now
        
        
        0.6 - Add Axis to matrix
        ------------------------
        
        * You can store axis to matrix if you want using parameter axis
        
        0.5 - BugFixes
        --------------
        
        * Fixed Bug on filtering data with pairs
        
        0.4 - Added Matrix-calculation
        -------------------------------
        
        * User can decide between matrix and table format for classification
        * Added examples for both
        * BugFix in count-method
        * Style improvements
        * Filter outliers in binning
        
        0.2 - Syntax Improvement
        ------------------------
        
        * Better documentation
        * Improved parameters of functions
        
        0.1 - Initial release
        ---------------------
        
        * Rainflow for HDF5 and Numpy-Arrays
        * Classification before and after algorithm
        * Removing peaks from data before calculation
