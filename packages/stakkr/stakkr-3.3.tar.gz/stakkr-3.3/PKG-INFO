        Stakkr is a a docker recompose tool that uses docker compose to easily
        create / maintain a stack of services, for example for web development.
        
        Via a configuration file you can setup the required services and
        let stakkr link and start everything for you.
        
        It works only in CLI.

        Versions
        =============
        .. IMPORTANT::
           Stakkr has known 3 versions and 3 names :
           - 1.x : it was called ``docker-lamp`` and was made to setup an Apache + PHP + MySQL Environment
           - 2.x : it was called ``marina`` (nice name!) and was made to have a stack build around various
           services.
           - 3.x : current version (and probably future ones) , now ``stakkr``. Why changing its name again ?
           Because marina is used by various people and therefore our tool could add more confusion.
        
        
        
        What does that do exactly ?
        ==============================
        If you have heard of Docker, you know that when you need to build a full environment
        with multiple services that are linked, you either have to do everything manually or
        use `docker-compose`. The second solution is the best _but_ it implies that you need, for each
        environment, to change your parameters, choose your images, learn the `docker-compose` command
        line tool, etc ... In brief, it's not very flexible and hard to learn.
        
        Stakkr will help you, via a very simple configuration file and a predefined list of services
        (that can be extended by plugins) to build a complete environment. Plus, to control it in command line.
        It makes use of docker easy.
        
        Last, but not the least, it's highly configurable and each service mounts a volume to have a persistence
        of data. You can even, if you want, add more directives on some services (change the `php.ini` for
        example and chose your versions (PHP 5.3 or 5.6 or 7.1 or anything else).
        
        
        Examples
        ==============
        You can combine services as you want to have :
        
        - A **Dev LAMP stack** (Apache + MySQL 5.7 + PHP 7.1 with xdebug and xhprof) ...
          and if suddenly you want to test your code with PHP 7.1,
          change it in `conf/compose.ini`, restart, it's done !
        - Or Apache 2.4 + PHP 5.6 + MongoDB for a **production environment**
        - Or **only Maildev**
        - Or **only PHP 5.4 + ElasticSearch**
        - etc...
