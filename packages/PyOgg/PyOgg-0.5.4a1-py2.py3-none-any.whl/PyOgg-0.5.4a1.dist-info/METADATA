PyOgg provides bindings for Xiph.org's OGG Vorbis and OGG Opus audio file formats.

It requires libogg.dll and at least either OGG Opus' libraries (libopus.dll, libopusfile.dll) and / or OGG Vorbis' libraries (libvorbis.dll, libvorbisfile.dll) to support Opus and Vorbis respectively.
(PyOgg is technically cross-platform, but it currently only searches for Windows .DLL files)

All the functions, structures and datatypes are the same as in the C++ implementation, except for some that couldn't be translated.
If you want to use them natively you will have to use ctypes' data types.
Please refer to the official documentation and the C++ headers.

You can import the various functions from pyogg.ogg, pyogg.vorbis and pyogg.opus or use the predefined classes and functions from pyogg.

PyOgg is not capable of playing files, however, you can use OpenAL for normal or even 3D playback with `PyOpenAL <https://github.com/Zuzu-Typ/PyOpenAL>`_.
