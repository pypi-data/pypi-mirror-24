bare68k
=======

bare68k allows you to write **m68k system emulators** in Python 2 or 3.  It
consists of a **CPU emulation** for 68000/68020/68EC020 provided by the
`Musashi`_ engine written in native C. A **memory map** with RAM, ROM,
special function is added and you can start the CPU emulation of your system.
You can intercept the running code with a trap mechanism and use powerful
diagnose functions,

Features
--------

* all emulation code written in C for fast speed
* runs on Python 2.7 and Python 3.5
* emulates CPU 68000, 68020, and 68EC020
* use a 24 or 32 bit memory map
* define memory regions for RAM and ROM with page granularity (64k)
* special memory regions that call your code for each read/write operation
* intercept m68k code by placing ALINE-opcode based traps to call your code
* event-based CPU emulation frontend does always return to Python first
* provide Python handlers for all CPU emulation events

  * RESET opcode
  * ALINE trap opcode
  * invalid memory access (e.g. write in ROM region)
  * out of memory bounds (e.g. read above memory map)
  * control interrupt acknowledgement
  * watch and break points
  * custom timers based on CPU cycles

* extensive diagnose functions

  * instruction trace
  * memory access for both CPU and Python API
  * register dump
  * memory labels to mark memory regions with arbitrary Python data
  * all bare68k components use Python logging

* rich API to configure memory and CPU state
* store/restore CPU context

Installation
------------

* use pip::

  $ pip install bare68k

* use github repository::

  $ python setup.py install

* use dev setup::

  $ python setup.py develop --user

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a small code to see **bare68k** in action::

    from bare68k import *
    from bare68k.consts import *

    # configure logging
    runtime.log_setup()

    # configure CPU: emulate a classic m68k
    cpu_cfg = CPUConfig(M68K_CPU_TYPE_68000)

    # now define the memory layout of the system
    mem_cfg = MemoryConfig()
    # let's create a RAM page (64k) starting at address 0
    mem_cfg.add_ram_range(0, 1)
    # let's create a ROM page (64k) starting at address 0x20000
    mem_cfg.add_rom_range(2, 1)

    # use a default run configuration (no debugging enabled)
    run_cfg = RunConfig()

    # combine everythin into a Runtime instance for your system
    rt = Runtime(cpu_cfg, mem_cfg, run_cfg)

    # fill in some code
    PROG_BASE=0x1000
    STACK=0x800
    mem = rt.get_mem()
    mem.w16(PROG_BASE, 0x23c0) # move.l d0,<32b_addr>
    mem.w32(PROG_BASE+2, 0)
    mem.w16(PROG_BASE+6, 0x4e70) # reset

    # setup CPU
    cpu = rt.get_cpu()
    cpu.w_reg(M68K_REG_D0, 0x42)

    # reset your virtual CPU to start at PROG_BASE and setup initial stack
    rt.reset(PROG_BASE, STACK)

    # now run the CPU emulation until an event occurrs
    # here the RESET opcode is the event we are waiting for
    rt.run()

    # read back some memory
    val = mem.r32(0)
    assert val == 0x42

    # finally shutdown runtime if its no longer used
    # and free resources like the allocated RAM, ROM memory
    rt.shutdown()
