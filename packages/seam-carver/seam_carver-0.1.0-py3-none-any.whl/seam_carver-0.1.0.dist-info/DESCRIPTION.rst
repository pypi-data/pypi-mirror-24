seam_carver is a small tool for retargetting images to any dimension greater or smaller.
It uses the process of seam carving as originally described by Shai Avidan & Ariel Shamir in http://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf

A combination of the gradient energy (determined with the sobel filter) and a simple color energy is
used to determine the least important seam. Additon of seams occurs by the same mechanism as described
in the paper.
