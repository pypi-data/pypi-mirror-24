History
-------

This project was started in 2015 with a simple question:

    How we can make a realiable software that can reduce our astronomical
    data retrieved and stored in the midle of the Andes
    (http://www.unciencia.unc.edu.ar/2015/junio/instalaran-un-telescopio-robotico-en-salta)

After some research we started building a framework that exploits the
capabilities data integrity of a relational databases and also measures our
own quality of code.
