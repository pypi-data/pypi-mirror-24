## xfcs Usage:
------------------------------------------------
### Overview:

XFCS can read and export any data within FCS 3.0, 3.1 compliant files. Default file type output is csv.

The intent of this project is to assist others in the analysis of flow cytometry data. With access to the data in a useable format, you are liberated from commercial software packages.

Short, cautionary notes in advance of riveting documention:
* The FCS text section (which I refer to as metadata), contains all necessary information to interpret, scale, and transform raw values.
Extracted data sets contain only the relevant numerical values per channel.
Use the conveniently included metadata option to generate a csv file alongside the data.

* If you are generating multiple metadata files, use the --output option to prevent overwrite. The default naming format has no concern for existing files of the same name.


------------------------------------------------
### File input:
With no input files entered, the current directory will be searched for fcs files. Applies to both data and metadata.
1. Recursive search:

    Enables recursive search of current directory.

        --recursive, -r

2. List input files:

    Optional designate input file(s) instead of default directory search.

        --input, -i file1.fcs file3.fcs

------------------------------------------------
### Extract Data:
        xfcsdata --options

All data sets are written to their own, separate file and named based on their source FCS file and the type of set. Default output is csv file in long aka third normal form with parameter names as column names.


#### Data Set Options:
Extracted data sets include all parameters relative to the specified transform. Except for raw output, time and event count data is included to all data sets. Any number of the options below can be enabled within the same command. If a file does not have parameters which apply to a requested data set, a notice will be displayed and other applicable data sets will be extracted.

Commands can be combined using their short version and each data set will still generate their own file. e.g. extract raw, channel, and scale values simultaneously

    xfcsdata -wcs

1. Raw:

    Parameter data extracted with no scaling, transforms or bit masks applied.

        --raw, -w

2. Channel:

    Raw data with bit masks, if applicable. Time is normalized to start at 0 (unless --ref-time enabled).
    Event count is normalized if it exists (unless --ref-count enabled) or it is automatically added.

        --channel, -c

3. Scale:

    Includes only parameters with a log10 or gain scale applied.
    Event count and time automatically included.

        --scale, -s

4. Channel Scale (xcxs):

    Includes any parameter channel values that do not have a scale value, all parameter scale values.
    Event count and time automatically included.

        --xcxs, -x

5. Fluorescence Compensated:

    Parameters located in $SPILLOVER matrix and their compensated channel values. Event count and time automatically included.

        --fl-comp, -f

6. Scaled Fluorescence Compensated:

    Any parameter with both compensation and log10 scaling. Log scaling is applied to fluorescence compensated values. Event count and time automatically included.

        --scale-fl-comp, -p

#### Time and Event Count Options:
1. Use actual event count parameter data (if it exists) instead of normalizing start to one.

        --ref-count, -e

2. Use actual time parameter data (if it exists) instead of normalizing start to zero.

        --ref-time, -t

#### Output Options:
- Output defaults to csv file. To use HDF5 instead:

        --hdf5

- Automatically generate metadata csv file for each fcs file.

        --metadata, -m

------------------------------------------------
### Extract Metadata:

    xfcsmeta --options

Extracts all header and text section keyword, value pairs and writes content to csv file. Multiple FCS files can be written to the same csv file regardless of shared keywords. Default format is wide.

#### Third normal form (long, tidy):
Outputs CSV in long format where each row is one fcs file.

        --tidy, -t

#### Additional Input Option:
Limit input to n number of most recent files.

      --limit n, -l n

#### Output Option:
Default behavior is for all FCS files to be included within the same csv file and named based on the current directory. One of the 2 options below can be selected to enable either separate metadata files per FCS file, or specified filename and filepath for the default merged csv file.

- Each input FCS file generates one csv file.

        --sep-files, -s

- Designate the output .csv filepath for combined, default metadata file. Also applies to a merged file which utilizes a previously generated csv file.

        --output file.csv, -o file.csv


#### Keyword Metadata Option:

- Keyword text file.

    Generate user keyword text file containing all keywords located within all FCS files scanned. Necessary for utilizing Keyword filtering and statistics. Generates FCS_USER_KW.txt within current directory.

        --get-kw, -g


- Keyword Filter and Stats.

    Filter text section keyword values to create custom metadata output. Remove any unwanted keywords from FCS_USER_KW.txt and enter path in command like below. Additional numeric keyword statistics described at the end.

        --kw-filter user_kw.txt, -k user_kw.txt


- Merge.

    Append new FCS metadata to existing FCS metadata csv file. Keywords used in existing metadata file will act as a filter for new FCS files. Filename output option will work in conjunction with this command.

        --append-to metadata_filepath.csv, -a metadata_filepath.csv

------------------------------------------------
### Metadata Numeric Keyword Mean:

Using the FCS_USER_KW.txt file, a numeric keyword can have a rolling mean column added to metadata output. Default historic mean range is 10 but can be specified. If used in combination with the add on module xfcsdashboard, parameter mean values will be groupd with their source for easy comparison.

Appending MEAN to any keyword will enable this feature.

Example keyword: $P25V
- enable mean column
    $P25V_MEAN
- enable mean column with history of 5 last values
    $P25V_MEAN_5

If you are tracking values from multiple machine configurations, the parameter id numbers are not necessarily standardized. For example: $P4N is FS Lin in one configuration, after disabling color channels $P4N is now SS Area. Tracking the voltage of $P4V will now be problematic for you.

Luckily, I have a solution which requires little effort.

1. Determine the channel names for current parameter id numbers.
    This information can be found within a metadata file or quickly located by using the following command:
            xfcsmeta --spx-names

2. Edit your keyword prefs text file and include any mean values using the specific channel attribute and name. If you are tracking voltage and want $P4V, include this line in the keyword text file:

        $PxV_FSLIN_MEAN_10

By utilizing this notation, xfcs will match the paramter by name to all other files. If FS Lin is $P8 in a different configuration, it will include the correct $P8V value within the same column. Please feel free to locate my email within the setup file and ask any questions. I like to be helpful but am moreso curious if anyone has read this (far).

Enjoy your flow data!
