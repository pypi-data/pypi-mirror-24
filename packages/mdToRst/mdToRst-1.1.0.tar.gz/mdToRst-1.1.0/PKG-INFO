Description: mdToRst
        =======
        
        Tool and library to convert markdown to restructed text (md to rst).
        
        
        This tool performs some basic conversions to attempt to generate a restructed text document (RST) which renders the same, or as close as possible to a provided markdown (md).
        
        This tool is not perfect, and may require that you write your markdown in a certain way that is apt toward conversion, but it does save a lot of time and prevent error.
        
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        It does not make sense and is very error prone to manage two different copies of the same documentation.
        
        I really like markdown, and I absolutely despise restructed text.
        
        Unfortunately, github prefers markdown and pypi will only use RST, so all of my python projects need to have a distinct MD and RST.
        
        The goal here is to simplify things to where you only have to write and maintain a markdown copy (README.md), and after changes you simply run README.md through mdToRst in order to output README.rst .
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        	Usage: mdToRst [filename]
        
        		Converts a provided markdown file (.md) to restructed text (.rst)
        
        	If "filename" is provided as "\-\-", the markdown will be read from stdin.
        
        	Example Usage:
        
        		mdToRst README.md | tee README.rst  # Read in README.md, convert to rst, 
        
        											#  and output both to stdout and "README.rst"
        
        
        		cat README.md | mdToRst         # Pipe in the contents of "README.md", and
        
        										#  output the converted document to stdout
        
        
        
        Modification
        ------------
        
        If you have a usage scenario where mdToRst generates incorrect or suboptimal results, please submit an issue detailing:
        
        * How to reproduce the issue
        
        * What the expected result is
        
        * Why this makes sense
        
        * How to achieve the equivilant in RST
        
        
        and optionally submit a patch as well.
