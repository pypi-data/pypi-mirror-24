        Discrete Sibson (Natural Neighbor) Interpolation
        ================================================
        
        Natural neighbor interpolation is a method for interpolating scattered data
        (i.e. you know the values of a function at scattered locations).  It is often superior to linear barycentric interpolation, which is a commonly used method of interpolation provided by Scipy's `griddata` function.
        
        There are several implementations of 2D natural neighbor interpolation in Python.  We needed a fast 3D implementation that could run without a GPU, so we wrote an implementation of Discrete Sibson Interpolation (a version of natural neighbor interpolation that is fast but introduces slight errors as compared to "geometric" natural neighbor interpolation).
        
        See https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.27 for details.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        - Python 3.4+
        - Numpy (has been tested with 1.13+)
        
        Demonstration
        -------------
        
        Natural neighbor interpolation can be more accurate than linear barycentric interpolation (Scipy's default) for smoothly varying functions.
        
        Also, the final result looks better.

        Future Work
        -----------
        
        - Provide options for extrapolation handling
        - Support floats and complex numbers (only support doubles at the moment)
        - Support 2D (only support 3D)
        - Add documentation with discussion on limitations of discrete sibson's method
        - Uncomment cpplint from tox.ini and cleanup C++ code
