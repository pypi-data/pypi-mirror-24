Description: Discrete Sibson (Natural Neighbor) Interpolation
        ================================================
        
        Natural neighbor interpolation is a method for interpolating scattered data
        (i.e. you know the values of a function at scattered locations).  It is often superior to linear barycentric interpolation, which is a commonly used method of interpolation provided by Scipy's `griddata` function.
        
        There are several implementations of 2D natural neighbor interpolation in Python.  We needed a fast 3D implementation that could run without a GPU, so we wrote an implementation of Discrete Sibson Interpolation (a version of natural neighbor interpolation that is fast but introduces slight errors as compared to "geometric" natural neighbor interpolation).
        
        See https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.27 for details.
        
        Future Work
        -----------
        
        - Change arguments so that you don't need to pass in a full grid (i.e. change
          from the `griddata` API); this is good because it reduces memory footprint
          and, unlike other griddata methods, I think we really need our interpolated
          points to lie on a grid.
        - Add a bunch of tests
        - Check that the input dimensions are correct
        - Add option to avoid extrapolation
        - Support floats and doubles
        - Support 2D
        - Support higher dimensions (?)
        - Add documentation with discussion on limitations of discrete sibson's method
        - Make it pip installable
