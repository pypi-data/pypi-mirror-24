| A Python module to learn all the major algorithms on the go!
| Purely for educational purposes

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Super easy to use
* A very easy to understand `Documentation <http://pygorithm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* Get the code right in your editor
* Get time complexities on the go

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Just fire the following command in your terminal:

::

   pip3 install pygorithm

- | It's that easy. If you are using Python 2.7 use pip instead. Depending on your
  | permissions, you might need to use ``pip install --user pygorithm`` to install.

* Or you can download the source code from `here <https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm>`_, and then just install the package using

::

    python setup.py install


Quick Start Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To sort your list

.. code:: python

    from pygorithm.sorting import bubble_sort
    myList = [12, 4, 3, 5, 13, 1, 17, 19, 15]
    sortedList = bubble_sort.sort(myList)
    print(sortedList)


* To get the code for function used

.. code:: python

    from pygorithm.sorting import bubble_sort
    code = bubble_sort.get_code()
    print(code)


* To get the time complexity of an algorithm

.. code:: python

    from pygorithm.sorting import bubble_sort
    time_complexity = bubble_sort.time_complexities()
    print(time_complexity)

* To see all the available functions in a module. For example, if you want to see what all sorts are available in the sorting module, then just do

.. code:: python

    >>> from pygorithm.sorting import modules
    >>> modules()
    ['bubble_sort', 'bucket_sort', 'counting_sort', 'heap_sort', 'insertion_sort', 'merge_sort', 'quick_sort', 'selection_sort', 'shell_sort']

Tests
~~~~~

* Just type in the following command to run the tests
::

    python3 -m unittest

* This will run all the tests defined in the files of the ``tests/`` directory
