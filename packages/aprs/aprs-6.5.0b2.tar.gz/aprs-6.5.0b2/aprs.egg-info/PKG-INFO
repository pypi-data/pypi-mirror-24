Description: aprs - Python APRS Module
        *************************
        
        aprs is a Python Module that supports connecting to APRS Interfaces, and
        receiving, parsing and sending APRS Frames.
        
        Included are several Interface Classes:
        
        * APRS - Abstract Class from which all other Interfaces are inherited.
        * TCP - Interfaces Class for connecting to APRS-IS via TCP. Can send or receive APRS Frames.
        * UDP - Interfaces Class for connecting to APRS-IS via UDP. Only supports sending APRS Frames.
        * HTTP - Interfaces Class for connecting to APRS-IS via HTTP. Currently only supports sending APRS Frames.
        
        Additional Interface Classes for connecting to KISS Interfaces are included:
        
        * SerialKISS - Interface Class for connecting to KISS Serial devices. Can send or receive APRS Frames.
        * TCPKISS - Interface Class for connecting to KISS TCP Hosts. Can send or receive APRS Frames.
        
        Finally, Frame and Callsign classes are included:
        
        * Frame - Describes the components of an APRS Frame.
        * Callsign - Describes the components of an APRS Callsign.
        
        
        Versions
        ========
        
        - 6.5.x branch will be the last version of this Module that supports Python 2.7.x
        - 7.x.x branch and-on will be Python 3.x ONLY.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Install from pypi using pip: ``pip install aprs``
        
        
        Usage Examples
        ==============
        
        Example 1: Library Usage - Receive
        ----------------------------------
        
        The following example connects to APRS-IS as W2GMD (me!) and filters for APRS
        frames coming from my prefix (W2GMD, W2GMD-n, etc). Any frames returned are
        sent to my callback *p* and printed.
        
        Example 1 Code
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ::
        
            import aprs
        
            def p(x): print(x)
        
            a = aprs.TCP('W2GMD', '12345')
            a.start()
        
            a.receive(callback=p)
        
        Example 1 Output
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ::
        
            W2GMD-6>APRX28,TCPIP*,qAC,APRSFI-I1:T#471,7.5,34.7,37.0,1.0,137.0,00000000
        
        Example 2: Library Usage - Send
        ----------------------------------
        
        The following example connects to APRS-IS as W2GMD (me!) and sends an APRS
        frame.
        
        Example 2 Code
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ::
        
            import aprs
        
            frame = aprs.Frame('W2GMD>APRS:>Hello World!')
        
            a = aprs.TCP('W2GMD', '12345')
            a.start()
        
            a.send(frame)
