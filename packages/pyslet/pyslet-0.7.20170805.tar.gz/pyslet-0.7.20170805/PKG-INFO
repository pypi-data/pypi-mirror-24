Description: Welcome to Pyslet
        =================
        
        ..  note::
            You are reading documentation for the pyslet-0.7.20170805 release of
            Pyslet to PyPi. The latest version, corresponding to the GitHub
            master is available here__
            
            ..  __: http://pyslet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        Pyslet_ is a Python package for Standards in Learning Education and
        Training (LET). It implements a number of LET-specific standards,
        including IMS QTI, Content Packaging and Basic LTI.  It also includes
        support for some general standards, including the data access standard
        OData (see http://www.odata.org).
        
        ..  _Pyslet: http://www.pyslet.org
        
        Pyslet was originally written to be the engine behind the QTI migration
        tool but it can be used independently as a support module for your own
        Python applications.
        
        Full documentation is hosted at http://pyslet.readthedocs.org
        
        Pyslet currently supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+, see docs for details.
        
          
        
        Distribution
        ------------
        
        Pyslet is developed on GitHub: https://github.com/swl10/pyslet but it
        can be downloaded and installed from the popular PyPi package
        distribution site: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyslet using *pip*.
        
        While Pyslet is being actively developed the version on PyPi may lag
        a few months behind the master branch on GitHub.  The unittests are
        fairly comprehensive and are automatically run against the master
        branch using TravisCI_:
        
        .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet.png
           :alt: Build Status
           :target: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet
        
        .. _TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet
        
        Users of older Python builds (e.g., Python 2.6 installed on older OS X
        versions) should be aware that pip may well fail to install itself or
        other modules due to a failure to connect to the PyPi repository. 
        Fixing this is hard and installing from source is recommended instead if
        you are afflicted by this issue.
        
        
        Installing from Source
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Pyslet package contains a setup.py script so you can install it
        by downloading the compressed archive, uncompressing it and then
        running the following command inside the package::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Windows users should note that when downloading a zipped archive of the
        distribution some unittests may fail due to the ambiguity in character
        encoding file names in zip archives.  This is not an issue with Pyslet
        itself but an issue with some of the test data in the unittests folder.
        If you use Git (or GitHub desktop) to checkout the master instead then
        the unittests should work, please report any errors as the continuous
        build system does not catch Windows-specific bugs.
        
        
        Current Status & Road Map
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Pyslet is going through a transition process at the moment as the QTI
        migration tool that drives its development is gradually moving towards
        being distributed as an LTI tool rather than a desktop application.
        
        The OData support is fairly robust, it is used to run the Cambridge Weather
        OData service which can be found at http://odata.pyslet.org/weather
        
        What's next?
        
        *   OData version 4: this will be a rewrite of the OData modules though
            they will ultimately behave in a similar way to the existing
            sub-package.
            
        *   MySQL shim for the OData SQL storage model (90% complete and
            functional)
        
        *   Improved support for LTI to take it beyond 'basic' (60% complete)

        Feedback
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        The best way to get something changed is to create an issue or Pull
        request on GitHub, however, my contact details are available there on my
        profile page if you just want to drop me an email with a suggestion or
        question.

        Some historical information is available on the QTI Migration tool's
        Google Code project:
        https://code.google.com/p/qtimigration/
        
        Some of the code was written in the 1990s and it owes a lot to the
        University of Cambridge and, in particular, to the team I worked with at
        UCLES (aka Cambridge Assessment) who were instrumental in getting this
        project started.
