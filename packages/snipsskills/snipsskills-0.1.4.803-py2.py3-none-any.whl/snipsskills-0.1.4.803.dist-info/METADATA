Snips Skills Manager
====================

|Build Status| |PyPI| |MIT License|

The Snips Skills Manager is a tool for easily setting up and managing a Snips assistant.

A single configuration file, the `Snipsfile <https://github.com/michaelfester/awesome-snips/>`_, is required to create a Snips assistant. In it, you specify:

- The URL of your assistant, as created in the `Snips Console <https://console.snips.ai>`_
- The `skills <https://github.com/michaelfester/awesome-snips/>`_ you want to install
- Bindings between intents and skills
- If required, additional parameters for you skill, such as an API key or the address of a lamp
- Various configuration parameters, such as language and logging preferences.

Check out `Awesome Snips <https://github.com/michaelfester/awesome-snips/>`_, a curated list of Snips skills, assistants and other resources to get you started. In particular, make sure to read the `Getting Started guide <https://github.com/michaelfester/awesome-snips/>`_.

Installation
------------

The Snips Skills Manager is on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/snipsskills>`_, so you can just install it with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install snipsskills

Note: you may need to install ``pip``, ``python-dev`` and ``pyaudio`` and ``pygame`` on your system beforehand. On Raspberry, this can be done via ``apt-get``:

.. code-block:: console
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-pyaudio python-pygame

Usage
-----

Start your project by creating a ``Snipsfile``, which is where all the configuration is set. This is a simple text file, adhering to the YAML format. Here is a basic configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    assistant: SNIPS_ASSISTANT_URL
    locale: en_US
    logging: True
    default_location: Paris,fr
    skills:
      - package_name: snipshue
        class_name: SnipsHue
        pip: snipshue=0.1.2
        params:
          hostname: PHILIPS_HUE_IP
          username: PHILIPS_HUE_USERNAME
          light_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        intents:
          - intent: DeactivateObject
            action: "turn_off"
          - intent: ActivateLightColor
            action: "turn_on"

For further explanations and examples, check out our `Snipsfile Wiki <https://github.com/snipsco/snipsskills/wiki/The-Snipsfile>`_.

Next, setup the system by running the ``install`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snipsskills install

Note: make sure that the ``snipsskills`` is found in your ``$PATH``. If the above does not work, add the following to your ``~/.bashrc`` or equivalent:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin


We are now ready to start the service, using the ``run`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ snipsskills run
