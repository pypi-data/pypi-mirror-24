## Overview
Column is a thin wrapper on top of the Ansible API to serve
as an entry point for other code when Ansible is needed. Because Ansible
internal API is not officially exposed and thus changes frequently,
this wrapper can be used instead of touching Ansible directly so that
any further Ansible API changes will only incur change in this module.

This module exposes two classes:
column.APIRunner and column.SubprocessRunner

Both of these implement the API as described in column.Runner.
Each runner exposes two public methods:
run_playbook() and run_module().

## Try it out

### Prerequisites
* python 2.7 (python 3 is not fully supported by ansible)
* ansible 2.x
* six library

### Install & use
Install with pip:
```bash
pip install column
```
and in your python code do:
```python
from column import APIRunner
api_runner = APIRunner()
api_runner.run_module('localhost', remote_user=None)
```
## Running the API
```bash
python column/api/run.py
```

## Running the API in uWSGI
```bash
pip install uwsgi
uwsgi --socket 0.0.0.0:48620 --protocol=http -w column.api.wsgi
```

## Running in Docker
```docker
1. Update 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in the etc/column/column.conf file
2. docker build -t column-image .
3. docker run -d -p 48620:48620 -v <playbook-dir>:<container-dir> column-image (the directory should contain the playbook file)
```

## Documentation
TBD
