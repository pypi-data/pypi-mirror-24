Python PPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

PPHP

This is a spinoff of PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) that uses Python instead of the PHP language.

How to implement it into your server:
In your mess of import statements, add one more:
from pphp import do
Then, in your request handler, before you send the document:
html = do(html, GET_DATA, POST_DATA)
where html is the text of your html file, and GET_DATA and POST_DATA are dictionaries containing the GET and POST data respectively.

In an HTML file, to interpret Python code:
<p><?pphp print "Hello!" ?></p>
Anything between <?pphp and ?> will be executed - and the output given is any stdout written.
Some special things:
echo(text) - this is equivalent to sys.stdout.write(text)
__dom__ - this is the libxml DOM tree of the <html> element

Note: the do(html) function returns the html text WITHOUT THE <!DOCTYPE> DECLARATION. You may want to add this back yourself if necessary.
