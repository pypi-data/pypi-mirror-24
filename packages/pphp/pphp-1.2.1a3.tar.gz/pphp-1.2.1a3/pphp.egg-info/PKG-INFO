Description: Python PPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
        
        PPHP
        
        This is a spinoff of PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) that uses Python instead of the PHP language.
        
        How to use it:
        
        To host the server, simply run ``python -m PPHPServer``
        
        To execute Python code inside a file, use:
        
        ``<?pphp #code here (line breaks permitted) ?>``
        
        and output will be recorded in the same way as PHP - through stdout.
        
        Example:
        
        ``<p>Request method: <?pphp echo(_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) ?></p>``
        
        Some special globals:
        
        * ``echo(text)`` - this is equivalent to sys.stdout.write(text)
        * ``__script__`` - this is the entire script currently being executed
        * ``__db__`` - this is the server's database, more documentation below
        * ``_GET`` - this is the GET data as a dictionary
        * ``_POST`` - this is the POST data as a dictionary
        * ``_REQUEST`` - this is a combination of _GET and _POST
        * ``_SERVER`` - this is the equivalent of PHP's $_SERVER, with some exceptions described below.
        
        In _SERVER, the keys ``REQUEST_TIME, HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET, HTTP_HOST, HTTP_REFERER, HTTPS, REMOTE_HOST, SERVER_ADMIN, SERVER_SIGNATURE, SCRIPT_NAME, and SCRIPT_URI`` are all not available; and the key ``GATEWAY_INTERFACE`` returns the version of the ``cgi`` module, not the gateway interface.
        
        Data for a server can be stored using the global ``__db__``. This is simply a dictionary - you can store and retrieve values as such. Data in ``__db__`` is stored as JSON in the file ``__DATABASE__``, in the current working directory. Changes to ``__db__`` will only show up in ``__DATABASE__`` after all scripts have finished running.
