        ### Get SlackCat
        
        Download using pip via pypi.
        
        ```bash
        pip install slackcat
        ```
        
        Next, head to the [Slack Incoming WebHooks Configuration](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks), click
        the ``Add Configuration`` button and set the default configuration values to your
        liking. Once complete, copy the Webhook URL which we'll need in the next step.
        
        Open your ``~/.bash_profile`` file add following:
        
        ```bash
        
        export SLACKCAT_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/TXXX/BXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        ```
        
        _Make sure to replace the "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..." with the one provided above._
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```bash
        
        # - "Hey what's your public key dog?"
        slackcat @doug ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        
        # - "Do we still use that crypto library written by the Cheese Cake Factory?"
        grep -r 'from cheesecake.factory import x509' ./ | slackcat @paul
        
        # - "Are you sure it's on your path?"
        echo $PATH | slackcat "#general"
        
        # - "These queries filling up in syslog look suspicious"
        tail -f /var/log/syslog | slackcat "#general" -f
        ```
        
        ### Customization
        
        If you would like to override the bot's username, add the following line to your ``~/.bash_profile`` file:
        
        ```bash
        
        export SLACKCAT_USERNAME="abraham-linksys"
        ```
        
        If you would like to override the bot's icon image, add the following line to your ``~/.bash_profile`` file:
        
        ```bash
        
        export SLACKCAT_ICON_URL="http://via.placeholder.com/500x500.png"
        ```
        
        ### Development
        Development of "SlackCat" is facilitated exclusively on GitHub. Contributions in the form of patches, tests and feature creation and/or requests are very welcome and highly encouraged. Please open an issue if this tool does not function as you'd expect.
        
        **How to release updates**
        
        If this is the first time you're releasing to pypi, you'll need to run: ``pip install -r tests/dev_requirements.txt``.
        
        Once complete, execute the following commands:
        
        ```bash
        
        git checkout master
        
        # Increment the version number and tag the release.
        bumpversion [major|minor|patch]
        
        # Upload the distribution to PyPi
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
        
        # Since master often contains work-in-progress changes, increment the version
        # to a patch release to prevent inaccurate attribution.
        bumpversion --no-tag patch
        
        git push origin master --tags
        ```
