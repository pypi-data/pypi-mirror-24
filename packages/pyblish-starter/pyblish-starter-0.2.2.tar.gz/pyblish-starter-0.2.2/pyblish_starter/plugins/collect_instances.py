    """Gather instances by objectSet and pre-defined attribute

    This collector takes into account assets that are associated with
    an objectSet and marked with a unique identifier;

    Identifier:
        id (str): "pyblish.starter.instance"

    Supported Families:
        starter.model: Geometric representation of artwork
        starter.rig: An articulated model for animators.
            A rig may contain a series of sets in which to identify
            its contents.

            - cache_SEL: Should contain cachable polygonal meshes
            - controls_SEL: Should contain animatable controllers for animators
            - resources_SEL: Should contain nodes that reference external files

            Limitations:
                - Only Maya is supported
                - One (1) rig per scene file
                - Unmanaged history, it is up to the TD to ensure
                    history is up to par.
        starter.animation: Pointcache of `starter.rig`

    Limitations:
        - Does not take into account nodes connected to those
            within an objectSet. Extractors are assumed to export
            with history preserved, but this limits what they will
            be able to achieve and the amount of data available
            to validators.
