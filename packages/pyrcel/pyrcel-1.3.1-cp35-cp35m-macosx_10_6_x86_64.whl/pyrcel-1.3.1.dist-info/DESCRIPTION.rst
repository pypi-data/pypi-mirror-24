This code implements a relatively simple, adiabatic cloud parcel model for studying aerosol
activation. It allows the user to peform and iterate parcel model experiments in a simple
fashion through the use of an object-oriented implementation. Furthermore, interfaces for
several numerical solvers are built into the model so that users can choose whatever scheme
they would like to run with the model.
