    Evolutionary algorithm to optimize the district energy system's design.
    This algorithm optimizes the size and operation of technologies for a district heating network.
    electrical network are not considered but their burdens in terms electricity costs, efficiency and emissions
    is added on top of the optimization.
    The equipment for cooling networks is not optimized as it is assumed that all customers with cooling needs will be
    connected to a lake. in case there is not enough capacity from the lake, a chiller and cooling tower is used to
    cover the extra needs.
