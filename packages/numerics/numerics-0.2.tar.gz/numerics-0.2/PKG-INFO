        == Installation ==
        
        Because `numerics` is largely a bunch of experiments, it requires
        several packages.  Some of them *may* be challenging to install.
        Here's how, as best I know.
        
        === OSX ===
        
        For matplotlib:

        You may also have to manually refresh the font cache:
        
            cd ~/.matplotlib/
            fc-list  # Should take a couple minutes.

        == Libraries ==
        
        The following libraries, listed by language, may be worth investigating.
        
        === JavaScript ===
