/python experiments in numerics + plotting/

== Installation ==

Because `numerics` is largely a bunch of experiments, it requires
several packages.  Some of them *may* be challenging to install.
Here's how, as best I know.

=== OSX ===

For matplotlib:

You may also have to manually refresh the font cache:

    cd ~/.matplotlib/
    fc-list  # Should take a couple minutes.

== Libraries ==

The following libraries, listed by language, may be worth investigating.

=== JavaScript ===
