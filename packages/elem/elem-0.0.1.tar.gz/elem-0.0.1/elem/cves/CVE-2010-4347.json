This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis requires debugfs to be mounted on a local system in order to have access to the custom_method file. Debugfs is not mounted by default. You need to run \"mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug\" as root first.\n    ", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "6.9"}}
