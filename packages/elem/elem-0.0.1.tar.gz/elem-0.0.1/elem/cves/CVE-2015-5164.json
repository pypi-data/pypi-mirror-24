The Qpid server did not properly restrict message types that can be sent from managed content hosts. An attacker with administrative access to a managed content host could send arbitrary messages containing pickle()-encoded data, which would then be processed on the Satellite 6 server and result in possible code execution.\n    "], "cwe": "CWE-502", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "3.5"}}
