NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Ruby OpenSSL team and third parties, who state that the original demonstration PoC contains errors and redundant or unnecessarily-complex code that does not appear to be related to a demonstration of the issue. As of 20140502, CVE is not aware of any public comment by the original researcher.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "2.6"}}
