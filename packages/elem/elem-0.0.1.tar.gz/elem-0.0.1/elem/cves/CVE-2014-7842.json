In the case of a local denial of service, an attacker must have access to the MMIO area or be able to access an I/O port. Please note that on certain systems, HPET is mapped to userspace as part of vdso (vvar) and thus an unprivileged user may generate MMIO transactions (and enter the emulator) this way.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect the kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n    ", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "4.0"}}
