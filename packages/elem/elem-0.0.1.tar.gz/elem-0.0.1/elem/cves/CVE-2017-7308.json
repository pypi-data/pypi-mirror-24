Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, local unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.\n\nSo, this issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 in the default configuration.
