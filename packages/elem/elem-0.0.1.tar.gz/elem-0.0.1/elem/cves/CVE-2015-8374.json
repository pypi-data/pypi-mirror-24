The data between the new file size and the old file size was not discarded and the number of bytes used by the inode were not correctly decremented, which gave the wrong report for callers of the stat(2) syscall. This wasted metadata space and allowed for the truncated data to be leaked, and data corruption or loss to occur.  A caller of the clone ioctl could exploit this flaw by using only standard file-system operations without root access to read the truncated data.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.\n\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2.
