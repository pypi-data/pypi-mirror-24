A server polling for client-socket data could put the peer socket on a wait list; the peer socket could then close the connection, making the reference on the wait list no longer valid.  This could lead to bypassing the permissions on a Unix socket and packets being injected into the stream, and could also panic the machine (denial of service).\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise linux 5,7, MRG-2 and realtime kernels.\n\nThis issue affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and may be addressed in a future update.\n\nThis has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently\nplanned to be addressed in future updates.
