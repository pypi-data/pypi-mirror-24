The environment variable \"HTTP_PROXY\" is used by numerous web clients, including Go's net/http package, to specify a proxy server to use for HTTP and, in some cases, HTTPS requests. This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack.\n    "], "upstream_fix": "Go 1.6.3, Go 1.7rc2", "cwe": "CWE-20", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "5.0"}}
