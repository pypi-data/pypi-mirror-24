A reboot is not necessary for this\nchange to take effect but do make sure the module is not loaded in the first\nplace. You can verify that by running:\n\nlsmod | grep dccp\n\nYou may also consider removing the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability from the current\nglobal capability set to prevent kernel modules from being loaded or unloaded.\nThe CAP_SYS_MODULE has a capability number of 16 (see linux/capability.h). The\ndefault value has all the bits set. To remove this capability, you have to\nclear the 16th bit of the default 32-bit value, e.g. 0xffffff ^ (1 << 16):\n\necho 0xFFFEFFFF > /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound\n    ", "details": ["\nThe dccp_rcv_state_process function in net/dccp/input.c in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 does not properly handle packets for a CLOSED endpoint, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by sending a DCCP-Close packet followed by a DCCP-Reset packet.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not include support for the DCCP protocol.
