The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.\n    ", "\nAn XXE vulnerability was found in Apache Batik which could allow a remote attacker to retrieve the files on the vulnerable server's filesystem by uploading specially crafted SVG images.
