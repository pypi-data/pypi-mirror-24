This implementation is provided in jmx-remoting.sar, which is deployed by default in unsupported community releases of JBoss Application Server 5.x. This implementation does not implement security as defined in JSR 160, and therefore does not apply any authentication or authorization constraints. A remote attacker could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server. All of the supported Red Hat JBoss 5.x products are not affected by this issue in their default configuration. These products are only vulnerable if JMX remoting is enabled by manually deploying jmx-remoting.sar from the jboss-as/docs/examples directory. Unsupported community releases of JBoss Application Server 5.x are affected. All users of the standalone JBoss Remoting project are also affected.\n\nFor more information, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1120423\n    "], "cwe": "CWE-306", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "7.5"}}
