An unprivileged user on a local network could use IPv6 Neighbor Discovery ICMP to broadcast a non-route with a low hop limit, causing machines to lower the hop limit on existing IPv6 routes. If this limit is small enough, IPv6 packets would be dropped before reaching the final destination.\n    "], "cwe": "CWE-358", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "3.3"}}
