Generally speaking, these will be untrusted/unknown X servers only, as trusted remote X servers should be connected to via SSH (which provides end-point verification and authentication), or the local X server.  Because this flaw requires that the X server be changed (recompiled to deviate from a standard X server) in order to impact the X client, it requires root privileges on the X server to effect the change.  If this is a system where the X client and server are on the same (local) host, and an attacker is able to replace the X server binary, then they already have root privileges and no trust boundary is crossed.  With remote X servers, using SSH with strict host-key checking will prevent the X client from connecting to the X server without intervention, as the user will be alerted to host-key changes.\n    ", "cwe": "CWE-190->CWE-122", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "4.3"}}
