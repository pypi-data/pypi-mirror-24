The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211_CMD_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.
