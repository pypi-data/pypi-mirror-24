On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not call these hypercalls will also prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n    ", "references": ["\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-148.html\n    "], "details": ["\nThe mod_l2_entry function in arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 3.4 through 4.6.x does not properly validate level 2 page table entries, which allows local PV guest administrators to gain privileges via a crafted superpage mapping.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "7.1"}}
