When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual->physical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table).\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
