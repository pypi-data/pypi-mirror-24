The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.\n    "], "cwe": "CWE-502", "cvss3": {"status": "draft", "cvss3_scoring_vector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "cvss3_base_score": "8.1"}}
