The information leak is caused by a race condition when attempting to set and read the tty line discipline.  A local attacker could use the TIOCSETD (via tty_set_ldisc ) to switch to a new line discipline; a concurrent call to a TIOCGETD ioctl performing a read on a given tty could then access previously allocated memory.  Up to 4 bytes could be leaked when querying the line discipline or the kernel could panic with a NULL-pointer dereference.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue affects kernels in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.
