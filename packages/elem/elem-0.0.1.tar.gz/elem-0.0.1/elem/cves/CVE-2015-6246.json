This should disable the waveagent protocol.\n    ", "references": ["\nhttps://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2015-26\n    "], "details": ["\nThe dissect_wa_payload function in epan/dissectors/packet-waveagent.c in the WaveAgent dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 mishandles large tag values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect the version of wireshark as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
