Therefore they can be rate limited by adding \"loglvl=error/warning\" to the hypervisor command line or suppressed entirely by adding \"loglvl=error\". On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not call these hypercalls will also prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n    ", "references": ["\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-152.html\n    "], "details": ["\nXen 3.2.x through 4.6.x does not limit the number of printk console messages when logging certain pmu and profiling hypercalls, which allows local guests to cause a denial of service via a sequence of crafted (1) HYPERCALL_xenoprof_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_xenoprof_op function in common/xenoprof.c, or (2) HYPERVISOR_xenpmu_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_xenpmu_op function in arch/x86/cpu/vpmu.c.\n    "]}
