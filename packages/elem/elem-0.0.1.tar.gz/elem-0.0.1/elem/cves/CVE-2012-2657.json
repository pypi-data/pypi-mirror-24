NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since the ability to set this option typically implies that the attacker already has legitimate access to cause a DoS or execute code, and therefore the issue would not cross privilege boundaries. There may be limited attack scenarios if isql command-line options are exposed to an attacker, although it seems likely that other, more serious issues would also be exposed, and this issue might not cross privilege boundaries in that context.\n    "], "statement": "\nRed Hat does not consider a user assisted client crash such as this to be a security flaw.\n    ", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "3.3"}}
