The flaw occurs in the KVM module's Programmable Interval Timer(PIT) emulation, when PIT counters for channel 1 or 2 are set to zero(0) and a privileged user inside the guest attempts to read these counters. A privileged guest user with access to PIT I/O ports could exploit this issue to crash the host kernel (denial of service).\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nThis has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently\nplanned to be addressed in future updates.
