In general, the JDBC driver for the PostgreSQL database does not promise to work with server releases newer than the driver release. The Red Hat Security Response Team agrees with their assessment and so does not consider this to be a security flaw.\n    ", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "5.0"}}
