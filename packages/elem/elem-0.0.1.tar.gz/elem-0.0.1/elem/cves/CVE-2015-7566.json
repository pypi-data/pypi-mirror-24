The driver assumes that the device always has at least one bulk OUT endpoint. By using a specially crafted USB device (without a bulk OUT endpoint), an unprivileged user with physical access could trigger a kernel NULL-pointer dereference and cause a system panic (denial of service).\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.\n\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and MRG-2.
