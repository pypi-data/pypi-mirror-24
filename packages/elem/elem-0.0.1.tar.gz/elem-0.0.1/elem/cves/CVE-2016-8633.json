The vulnerability exists since firewire supported IPv4, i.e. since version 2.6.31 (year 2009) till version v4.9-rc4. A maliciously formed fragment with a respectively large datagram offset would cause a memcpy() past the datagram buffer, which would cause a system panic or possible arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe flaw requires [firewire-net] module to be loaded and is remotely exploitable from connected firewire devices, but not over a local network.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and MRG 2.x.
