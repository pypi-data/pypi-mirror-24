This resulted in the source user ID of messages not being checked. A client that can establish an AMQP connection with the broker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication. For Condor users, if condor-aviary is installed, this flaw could be used to submit jobs that would run as any user (except root, as Condor does not run jobs as root).\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "5.8"}}
