Additionally it does not appear that struts 1 is affected by this vulnerability (the affected code does not appear to be present in struts 1). Additionally it does not appear that Red Hat has backported any code from struts 2 to struts 1 as the code bases are quite different and backporting any significant code would be a major effort with questionable results due to compatibility issues.\n    ", "cvss3": {"status": "draft", "cvss3_scoring_vector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "cvss3_base_score": "9.8"}}
