An adaptive attack can be mounted to progressively extract the scalar input to ScalarMult by submitting crafted points and observing failures to the derive correct output. This leads to a full key recovery attack against static ECDH, as used in popular JWT libraries.\n    ", "\nA carry propagation flaw was found in the implementation of the P-256 elliptic curve in golang.
