Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 may address this issue.\n\nGiven the Moderate impact and the fact that BRTFS file system is no longer Technology preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n    "}
