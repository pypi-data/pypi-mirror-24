NOTE: it could be argued that because libxml2 already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed and each affected application would need its own CVE.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "4.3"}}
