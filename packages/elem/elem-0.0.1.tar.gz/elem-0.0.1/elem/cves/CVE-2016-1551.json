Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 as the Linux kernel drops packets from 127.0.0.0/8, mitigating this issue.\n    ", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "2.6"}}
