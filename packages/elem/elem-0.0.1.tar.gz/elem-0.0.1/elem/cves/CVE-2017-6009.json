A buffer overflow was observed in the \"decode_ne_resource_id\" function in the \"restable.c\" source file. This is happening because the \"len\" parameter for memcpy is not checked for size and thus becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects wrestool.\n    ", "\nA vulnerability was found in icoutils, in the wrestool program.
