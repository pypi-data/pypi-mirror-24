An attacker can leak file resources in the system by opening a large file with write permissions on a overlay filesystem that is insufficient to deal with the size of the write.\n\nWhen unmounting the underlying device, the system is unable to free an inode and this will consume resources.  Repeating this for all available inodes and memory will create a denial of service situation.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.\n\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux  7 and MRG-2.
