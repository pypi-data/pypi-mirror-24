As part of an HTTP alarm action, a user could pass in a trust ID, however, the trust could be from anyone because it was not verified.  Because the trust was then used by openstack-aodh to obtain a keystone token for the alarm action, a malicious user could pass in another person's trust ID and obtain a keystone token containing the delegated authority of that user.\n    "], "cwe": "CWE-345", "cvss3": {"status": "draft", "cvss3_scoring_vector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "cvss3_base_score": "4.9"}}
