However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.\n    ", "references": ["\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-146.html\n    "], "details": ["\nXen 4.4.x, 4.5.x, and 4.6.x does not limit the number of printk console messages when reporting unimplemented hypercalls, which allows local guests to cause a denial of service via a sequence of (1) HYPERVISOR_physdev_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_physdev_op function in arch/arm/physdev.c, or (2) HYPERVISOR_hvm_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_hvm_op function in arch/arm/hvm.c.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "4.3"}}
