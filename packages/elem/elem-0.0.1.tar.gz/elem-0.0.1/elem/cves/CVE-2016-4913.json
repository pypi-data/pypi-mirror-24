Payloads of NM entries are not supposed to contain NUL. When such entry is processed, only the part prior to the first NUL goes into the concatenation (i.e. the directory entry name being encoded by a bunch of NM entries).  The process stops when the amount collected so far + the claimed amount in the current NM entry exceed 254. However, the value returned as the total length is the sum of *claimed* sizes, not the actual amount collected. And that's what will be passed to readdir() callback as the name length - 8Kb __copy_to_user() from a buffer allocated by __get_free_page().\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6.
