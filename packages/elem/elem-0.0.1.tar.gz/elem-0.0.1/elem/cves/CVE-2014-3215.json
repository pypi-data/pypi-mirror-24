The subsequent invocation of suid root binaries that relied on the fact that the setuid() system call, among others, also sets the saved set-user-ID when dropping the binaries' process privileges, could allow a local, unprivileged user to potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Note: the fix for this issue is the kernel part of the overall fix, and introduces the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS functionality and the related SELinux exec transitions support.\n    "], "cwe": "CWE-270", "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "6.9"}}
