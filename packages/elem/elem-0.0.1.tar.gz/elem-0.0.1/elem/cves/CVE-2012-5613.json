NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's installation documentation.  NOTE: it could be argued that this should not be included in CVE because it is a configuration issue.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "4.6"}}
