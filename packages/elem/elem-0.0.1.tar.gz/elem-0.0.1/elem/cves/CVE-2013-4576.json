NOTE: applications are not typically expected to protect themselves from acoustic side-channel attacks, since this is arguably the responsibility of the physical device. Accordingly, issues of this type would not normally receive a CVE identifier. However, for this issue, the developer has specified a security policy in which GnuPG should offer side-channel resistance, and developer-specified security-policy violations are within the scope of CVE.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "status": "verified", "cvss_base_score": "2.9"}}
