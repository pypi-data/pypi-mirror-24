In the driver, the COMMAND_PORT variable was hard coded and set to 4 (5th element). The driver assumed that the number of ports would always be 5 and used port number 5 as the command port. However, when using a USB device in which the number of ports was set to a number less than 5 (for example, 3), the driver triggered a kernel NULL-pointer dereference. A non-privileged attacker could use this flaw to panic the host.\n    "], "statement": "\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and MRG-2.\n\nThis has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
