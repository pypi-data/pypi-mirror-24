NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design limitation of the Net::HTTPS API, and separate implementations should be independently assigned CVE identifiers for not working around this limitation. However, because this API was modified within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been assigned.\n    "], "cvss": {"cvss_scoring_vector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N", "status": "draft", "cvss_base_score": "5.8"}}
