It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and delete it if present.\n    "], "cvss3": {"status": "draft", "cvss3_scoring_vector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "cvss3_base_score": "4.0"}}
