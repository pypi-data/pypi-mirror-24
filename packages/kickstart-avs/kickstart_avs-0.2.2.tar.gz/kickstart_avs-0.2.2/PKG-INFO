        Motivation
        ----------
        
        `Alexa team <https://github.com/alexa>`__ have put together a
        step-by-step guide to build `Alexa Voice Service
        (AVS) <https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service>`__ on a
        ``Raspberry Pi``
        `here <https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi>`__.
        Although the `automated install
        script <https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/blob/master/automated_install.sh>`__
        builds the sample apps for enabling `Alexa Voice Service
        (AVS) <https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service>`__, there are
        two things that you have to do manually in order to get a full
        experience of owning an Amazon Alexa product (Echo, Dot, Look, etc):
        
        -  `run your web service, sample app and wake word
           engine <https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi#step-7-run-your-web-service-sample-app-and-wake-word-engine>`__
        -  Enable the above apps on startup
        
        About
        -----
        
        A simple package that launches Alexa Voice Service without you manually
        opening three consoles. Can be launched with a simple ``shell`` command
        that can be added to startup on a ``Raspberry Pi``.
