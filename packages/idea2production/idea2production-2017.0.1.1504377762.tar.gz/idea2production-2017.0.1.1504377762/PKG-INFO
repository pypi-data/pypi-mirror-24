        HRL From Idea to Production Tutorial
        ====================================
        
        This repo exists to provide  `an example setup.py <https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py/blob/master/setup.py>`_ file, that can be used to bootstrap your next Python project. It includes some advanced patterns and best practices for ``setup.py``, as well as some commented–out nice–to–haves.
        
        For example, this ``setup.py`` provides a ``$ python setup.py publish`` command, which creates a *universal wheel* (and *sdist*) and uploads your package to `PyPi <https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html>`_ using `Twine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_, without the need for an annoying ``setup.cfg`` file. 
        
        In short, ``setup.py`` files can be daunting to approach, when first starting out — even Guido has been heard saying, "everyone cargo cults thems". It's true — so, I want this repo to be the best place to copy–paste from :)

        To Do
        -----
        
        - Tests via ``$ setup.py test`` (if it's concise).
