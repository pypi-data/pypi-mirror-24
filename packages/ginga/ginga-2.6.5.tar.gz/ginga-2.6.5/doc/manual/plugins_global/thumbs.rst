Thumbs

The Thumbs plugin provides a thumbnail index of all images viewed since the
program was started.  By default, Thumbs appear in chronological viewing
history, with the newest images at the bottom and the oldest at the top.
The sorting can be made alphanumeric by a setting in the "plugin_Thumbs.cfg"
configuration file.

Usage
-----
Clicking on a thumbnail navigates you directly to that image in the
associated channel.  Hovering the cursor over a thumbnail will show a
tool tip that contains a couple of useful pieces of metadata from the
image.  Right-clicking on a thumbnail brings up a context menu with
options for displaying or removing an image.

The "Auto Scroll" checkbox, if checked, will cause the Thumbs pan to
scroll to the active image.
