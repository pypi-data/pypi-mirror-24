        Simple Flow is a Python library that provides abstractions to write programs in
        the `distributed dataflow paradigm
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_flow>`_. It relies on futures
        to describe the dependencies between tasks. It coordinates the execution of
        distributed tasks with Amazon `SWF <https://aws.amazon.com/swf/>`_.
        
        A ``Future`` object models the asynchronous execution of a computation that may
        end.
        
        It tries to mimics the interface of the Python `concurrent.futures
        <http://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures>`_ library.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Provides a ``Future`` abstraction to define dependencies between tasks.
        - Define asynchronous tasks from callables.
        - Handle workflows with Amazon SWF.
        - Implement replay behavior like the Amazon Flow framework.
        - Handle retry of tasks that failed.
        - Automatically register decorated tasks.
        - Encodes/decodes large fields to S3 objects transparently (aka "jumbo fields").
        - Handle the completion of a decision with more than 100 tasks.
        - Provides a local executor to check a workflow without Amazon SWF (see
          ``simpleflow --local`` command).
        - Provides decider and activity worker process for execution with Amazon SWF.
        - Ships with the ``simpleflow`` command. ``simpleflow --help`` for more information
          about the commands it supports.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Let's take a simple example that computes the result of ``(x + 1) * 2``. You
        will find this example in ``examples/basic.py``.
        
        We need to declare the functions as activities to make them available:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from simpleflow import (
                activity,
                Workflow,
                futures,
            )
        
            @activity.with_attributes(task_list='quickstart', version='example')
            def increment(x):
                return x + 1
        
            @activity.with_attributes(task_list='quickstart', version='example')
            def double(x):
                return x * 2
        
            @activity.with_attributes(task_list='quickstart', version='example')
            def delay(t, x):
                time.sleep(t)
                return x
        
        And then define the workflow itself in a ``example.py`` file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            class BasicWorkflow(Workflow):
                name = 'basic'
                version = 'example'
                task_list = 'example'
        
                def run(self, x, t=30):
                    y = self.submit(increment, x)
                    yy = self.submit(delay, t, y)
                    z = self.submit(double, y)
        
                    print('({x} + 1) * 2 = {result}'.format(
                        x=x,
                        result=z.result))
                    futures.wait(yy, z)
                    return z.result
        
        Now check that the workflow works locally with an integer "x" and a wait value "t"::
        
            $ simpleflow workflow.start --local examples.basic.BasicWorkflow --input '[1, 5]'
            (1 + 1) * 2 = 4
        
        *input* is encoded in JSON format and can contain the list of *positional*
        arguments such as ``'[1, 1]`` or a *dict* with the ``args`` and ``kwargs`` keys
        such as ``{"args": [1], "kwargs": {}}``, ``{"kwargs": {"x": 1}}``, or
        ``'{"args": [1], "kwargs": {"t": 5}}'```.
        
        Now that you are confident that the workflow should work, you can run it on
        Amazon SWF with the ``standalone`` command::
        
           $ simpleflow standalone --domain TestDomain examples.basic.BasicWorkflow --input '[1, 5]'
        
        The *standalone* command sets an unique task list and manage all the processes
        that are needed to execute the workflow: decider, activity worker, and a client
        that starts the workflow. It is very convenient for testing a workflow by
        executing it with SWF during the development steps or integration tests.
        
        Let's take a closer look to the workflow definition.
        
        It is a *class* that inherits from ``simpleflow.Workflow``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            class BasicWorkflow(Workflow):
        
        It defines 3 class attributes:
        
        - *name*, the name of the SWF workflow type.
        - *version*, the version of the SWF workflow type. It is currently provided
          only for labeling a workflow.
        - *task_list*, the default task list (see it as a dynamically created queue)
          where decision tasks for this workflow will be sent. Any *decider* that
          listens on this task list can handle this workflow. This value can be
          overrided by the simpleflow commands and objects.
        
        It also implements the ``run`` method that takes two arguments: ``x`` and
        ``t=30`` (i.e. ``t`` is optional and has the default value ``30``). These
        arguments are passed with the ``--input`` option. The ``run`` method
        describes the workflow and how its tasks should execute.
        
        Each time a decider takes a decision task, it executes again the ``run``
        from the start. When the workflow execution starts, it evaluates ``y =
        self.submit(increment, x)`` for the first time. *y* holds a future in state
        ``PENDING``. The execution continues with the line ``yy = self.submit(delay, t,
        y)``. *yy* holds another future in state ``PENDING``. This state means the task
        has not been scheduled. Now execution still continue in the ``run`` method
        with the line ``z = self.submit(double, y)``. Here it needs the value of the
        *y* future to evaluate the ``double`` activity. As the execution cannot
        continues, the decider schedules the task ``increment``. *yy* is not a
        dependency for any task so it is not scheduled.
        
        Once the decider has scheduled the task for *y*, it sleeps and waits for an
        event to be waken up. This happens when the ``increment`` task completes.
        SWF schedules a decision task. A decider takes it and executes the
        ``BasicWorkflow.run`` method again from the start. It evalues the line ``y
        = self.submit(increment, x)``. The task associated with the *y* future has
        completed. Hence *y* is in state ``FINISHED`` and contains the value ``2`` in
        ``y.result``. The execution continues until it blocks. It goes by ``yy =
        self.submit(delay, t, y)`` that stays the same. Then it reaches ``z =
        self.submit(double, y)``. It gets the value of ``y.result`` and *z* now holds a
        future in state ``PENDING``. Execution reaches the line with the ``print``. It
        blocks here because ``z.result`` is not available. The decider schedules the
        task backs by the *z* future: ``double(y)``. The workflow execution continues
        so forth by evaluating the ``BasicWorkflow.run`` again from the start until
        it finishes.
        
        
        Jumbo Fields
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For some use cases, you want to be able to have fields larger than the standard
        SWF limitations (which is maximum 32K bytes on the largest ones, input and result,
        and lower for some others).
        
        Simpleflow allows to transparently translate such fields to objects stored on AWS
        S3. The format is then the following:
        
            simpleflow+s3://jumbo-bucket/with/optional/prefix/5d7191af-3962-4c67-997a-cdd39a31ba61 5242880
        
        The format provides a pseudo-S3 address as a first word. The "simpleflow+s3://"
        prefix is here for implementation purposes, and may be extended later with other
        backends such as simpleflow+ssh or simpleflow+gs.
        
        The second word provides the length of the object in bytes, so a client parsing
        the SWF history can decide if it's worth it to pull/decode the object.
        
        For now jumbo fields are limited to 5MB in size. Simpleflow will perform disk caching
        for this feature to avoid issuing too many queries to S3, which would slow down
        the deciders especially. Disk cache is located at ``/tmp/simpleflow-cache`` and is
        limited to 1GB, with a LRU eviction strategy. It's performed with the `DiskCache
        library <http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/>`_.
        
        You have to configure an environment variable to tell simpleflow where to store
        things (which implicitly enables the feature by the way):
        
            SIMPLEFLOW_JUMBO_FIELDS_BUCKET=jumbo-bucket/with/optional/prefix
        
        And ensure your deciders and activity workers have access to this S3 bucket (``s3:GetObject`` and
        ``s3:PutObject`` should be enough, but please test it first).
        
        The overhead of the signature format is maximum 91 chars at this point (fixed protocol
        and UUID width, and max 5M = 5242880 for the size part). So you should ensure
        that your bucket + directory is not longer than 256 - 91 = 165 chars, else
        you may not be able to get a working jumbo field signature for tiny fields.
        In that case stripping the signature would only break things down the road
        in unpredictable and hard to debug ways, so simpleflow will raise.
        
        This feature is still in beta mode, and any feedback is appreciated.
        
        
        Commands
        --------
        
        Overview
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Please read and even run the ``demo`` script to have a quick glance of
        ``simpleflow`` commands. To run the ``demo``  you will need to start decider
        and activity worker processes.
        
        Start a decider with::
        
            $ simpleflow decider.start --domain TestDomain --task-list test examples.basic.BasicWorkflow
        
        Start an activity worker with::
        
            $ simpleflow worker.start --domain TestDomain --task-list quickstart
        
        Then execute ``./extras/demo``.
        
        Controlling SWF access
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The SWF region is controlled by the environment variable ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION``. This variable
        comes from the legacy "simple-workflow" project. The option might be exposed through a
        ``--region`` option in the future (if you want that, please open an issue).
        
        The SWF domain is controlled by the ``--domain`` on most simpleflow commands. It can also
        be set via the ``SWF_DOMAIN`` environment variable. In case both are supplied, the
        command-line value takes precedence over the environment variable.
        
        Note that some simpleflow commands expect the domain to be passed as a positionnal argument.
        In that case the environment variable has no effect for now.
        
        The number of retries for accessing SWF can be controlled via ``SWF_CONNECTION_RETRIES``
        (defaults to 5).
        
        The identity of SWF activity workers and deciders can be controlled via ``SIMPLEFLOW_IDENTITY``
        which should be a JSON-serialized string representing ``{ "key": "value" }`` pairs that
        adds up (or override) the basic identity provided by simpleflow. If some value is null in
        this JSON map, then the key is removed from the final SWF identity.
        
        
        List Workflow Executions
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Tasks Status
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can check the status of the workflow execution with::
        
            $ simpleflow --header workflow.tasks DOMAIN WORKFLOW_ID [RUN_ID] --nb-tasks 3

        Profiling
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can profile the execution of the workflow with::
        
            $ simpleflow --header workflow.profile TestDomain basic-example-1438722273
            Task                                 Last State    Scheduled           Time Scheduled  Start               Time Running  End                 Percentage of total time

        Controlling log verbosity
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can control log verbosity via the ``LOG_LEVEL`` environment variable. Default is ``INFO``. For instance,
        the following command will start a decider with ``DEBUG`` logs:
        
            $ LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG simpleflow decider.start --domain TestDomain --task-list test examples.basic.BasicWorkflow
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Full documentation (work-in-progress) is available at
        https://simpleflow.readthedocs.org/.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 2.6.x or 2.7.x
        - Python 3.x compatibility is NOT guaranteed for now: https://github.com/botify-labs/simpleflow/issues/87
        
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        A ``Dockerfile`` is provided to help development on non-Linux machines.
        
        You can build a ``simpleflow`` image with:
        
            ./script/docker-build
        
        And use it with:
        
            ./script/docker-run
        
        It will then mount your current directory inside the container and pass the
        most relevant variables (your AWS_* credentials for instance).
        
        
        Running tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can run tests with:
        
            ./script/test
        
        Any parameter passed to this script is propagated to the underlying call to ``py.test``.
        This wrapper script sets some environment variables which control the behavior of
        simpleflow during tests:
        
        - ``SIMPLEFLOW_CLEANUP_PROCESSES``: set to ``"yes"`` in tests, so tests will clean up child
          processes after each test case. You can set it to an empty string (``""``) or omit it if
          outside ``script/test`` if you want to debug things and take care of it yourself.
        - ``SIMPLEFLOW_ENV``: set to ``"test"`` in tests, which changes some constants to ease or
          speed up tests.
        - ``SWF_CONNECTION_RETRIES``: set to ``"1"`` in tests, which avoids having too many retries
          on the SWF API calls (5 by default in production).
        - ``SIMPLEFLOW_VCR_RECORD_MODE``: set to ``"none"`` in tests, which avoids running requests
          against the real SWF endpoints in tests. If you need to update cassettes, see
          ``tests/integration/README.md``
        
        
        Release
        -------
        
        In order to release a new version, you'll need credentials on pypi.python.org for this
        software, as long as write access to this repository. Ask via an issue if needed.
        Rough process:
        
            git checkout master
            git pull --rebase
            v=0.10.0
            vi simpleflow/__init__.py
            git add . && git commit -m "Bump version to $v"
            git tag $v
            git push --tags

        Python Simple Workflow
        ======================
        
        (This README was included with python-simple-workflow, now merged here as ``workflow.swf``.)
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/botify-labs/python-simple-workflow.png?branch=develop
        
        python-simple-workflow is a wrapper for `Amazon Simple Workflow <http://aws.amazon.com/en/swf/>`_ service.
        It aims to provide some abstractions over the webservice concepts through `Boto <https://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/swf.html>`_ library Swf api implementation.
        
        It aims to provide:
        
        * **Modelisation**: Swf entities and concepts are to be manipulated through `Models <http://test.com>`_ and `QuerySets <http://test.com>`_ (any ressemblance with the `Django <http://test.com>`_ api would not be a coincidence).
        * **High-level Events, History**: A higher level of abstractions over Swf *events* and *history*. Events are implemented as stateful objects aware of their own state and possible transitions. History enhance the events flow description, and can be compiled to check it's integrity and the activities statuses transitions.
        * **Decisions**: Stateful abstractions above the Swf decision making system.
        * **Actors**: Swf actors base implementation such as a `Decider <http://test.com>`_ or an activity task processor `Worker <http://test.com>`_ from which the user can easily inherit to implement it's own decision/processing model.
        
        It provides querysets and model objects over commonly used concepts: domains, workflow types, activity types, and so on.
        
        It is under MIT license, and any ideas, features requests, patches, pull requests to improve it are of course welcome.
