nanoget
=======

This module provides functions to extract useful metrics from Oxford
Nanopore sequencing reads and alignments.

FUNCTIONS
---------

| Data can be presented in the following formats, using the following
  functions:
| - A sorted bam file ``processBam(bamfile, threads)``
| - A standard fastq file ``processFastqPlain(fastqfile)``
| - A fastq file with metadata from MinKNOW or Albacore
  ``processFastq_rich(fastqfile)``
| - A sequencing\_summary file generated by Albacore
  ``processSummary(sequencing_summary.txt)``

Fastq files can be compressed using gzip, bzip2 or bgzip. The data is
returned as a pandas DataFrame with standardized headernames for
convenient extraction. The functions perform logging while being called
and extracting data.

INSTALLATION
------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install nanoget

| or
| |install with conda|

::

    conda install -c bioconda nanoget
