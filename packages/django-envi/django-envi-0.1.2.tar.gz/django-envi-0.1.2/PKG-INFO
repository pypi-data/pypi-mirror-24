        Lightweight set of middleware classes that inject visual indicators for 
        each type of environment that a project is deployed to. Inspired by 
        [this article][1].

        ## Quickstart
        
        1. Install the package: `pip install django-environments`.
        2. Add the `'environments'` app to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
        3. Install the desired middleware class to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`:
           * `environments.middleware.EnvironmentFooterMiddleware` injects a 
           sticky footer to all pages that displays the current environment.
        4. In each environment's settings file, add the `ENVIRONMENT_KEY` setting, 
           with its value set to one of:
           * `'local'`: A striped grey banner. Appears site-wide (_default_).
           * `'dev'`: A striped blue banner. Appears site-wide.
           * `'staging'`: A striped yellow banner. Appears site-wide.
           * `'production'`: A striped red banner. Only appears in `/admin`.
