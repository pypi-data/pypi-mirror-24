        sipster
        =======
        
        Toying around with using aiosip for agent/scenario testing similar to
        how SIPp works. Lost of stuff to do, but looking very, very promising.
        
        Currently almost non-functional, part of a fast answer scenario is
        implemented, and that requires a customized aiosip install which I
        haven't published yet - its stuff I want to get upstreamed.
        
        To run it:
        
        -------
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            python -m sipster.scenarios.fastanswer
        
        ----
        TODO
        ----
        
        - Upstream API changes where makes sense
        - Integrate RTP and DTMF support from aiortp
        - pytest integration via plugin
        - Provide a set of useful general SIP compliance tests
