        Overview
        ========
        This package contains decorators for printing a command line animation while
        the decorated function runs. It is very similar to the ``decorating`` package,
        which currently has way more features and probably serves you better then
        ``clanim``. I wanted to create ``clanim`` anyway as a means of practicing
        with decorators and command line animations. It doesn't seem like ``decorating`` 
        currently supports async functions, so that's the one area where ``clanim`` 
        potentially is superior at this time.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        Python 3.6 or higher and the ``daiquiri`` package (used for development and
        will probably be removed in a final release).
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        The API for ``clanim`` consists of the ``@animate`` decorator, as well as the
        animations in ``clanim.animation``. All of these are package level imports,
        so e.g. the ``@animate`` decorator can be accessed like this:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # option 1
            import clanim
        
            @clanim.animate
            def func():
                time.sleep(2)
        
            # option 2
            from clanim import animate
        
            @animate
            def func():
                time.sleep(2)
        
        The ``animate`` decorator works both with and without parameters, and supports
        both regular functions:

        and async functions:

        Install
        =======
        Option 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``
        ----------------------------------------
        The latest release of ``clanim`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual
        with ``pip``.  I strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo
        pip install <package>``), as this may land you with incompatible packages in a
        very short amount of time. A per-user install can be done like this:
        
        1. Execute ``pip install --user clanim`` to install the package.
        2. Further steps to be added ...
        
        
        Option 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``
        -----------------------------------------------------
        If you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release
        versions are uploaded to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this
        yourself, I suggest going with the release version.
        
        1. Clone the repo with ``git``:
            - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/clanim``
        2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.
            - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.
            - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.
            - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.
        3. Further steps to be added ...

        Contributing
        ============
        I will happily take contributions, especially in terms of new animations.
        Submit a pull request if you have an idea, and let me approve the idea before
        you start working on something I would not like in the project!
