Requirements
============

pycraf has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`__ 3.5 or later

- `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__: Used for the package
  installation.

- `Cython <http://cython.org/>`__ 1.8 or later

- `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ 1.8 or later

- `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`__: Used in various routines.

- `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__: Used all over the place.

- `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`__ 2.6 or later


There are a few optional packages, which are necessary for some functionality:

- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ 1.5 or later: To provide plotting
  functionality that `~pycraf.pathprof.helper` enhances.

- `pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`__ 1.9 or later: This is a
  requirement for the `~pycraf.geospatial` package.

- `sgp4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sgp4>`__ 1.4 or later: This is a
  requirement for the `~pycraf.satellite` package.


Installing pycraf
==================

Using pip
-------------

To install pycraf with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`__, simply run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pycraf

.. note::

    You will need a C compiler (``gcc``) to be installed for the installation
    to succeed. Since `pycraf` needs OpenMP, ``clang`` is currently not
    supported.

.. note::

    Use the ``--no-deps`` flag if you already have dependency packages
    installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to "help" you
    by upgrading your installation, which may not always be desired.

.. note::

    If you get a ``PermissionError`` this means that you do not have the
    required administrative access to install new packages to your Python
    installation.  In this case you may consider using the ``--user`` option
    to install the package into your home directory.  You can read more
    about how to do this in the `pip documentation
    <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.2.1/other-tools.html#using-pip-with-the-user-scheme>`__.

    We recommend to use a Python distribution, such as `Anaconda
    <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_, especially, if you are on
    :ref:`windows_install`.

    Do **not** install pycraf or other third-party packages using ``sudo``
    unless you are fully aware of the risks.


.. _windows_install:

Installation on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note, for Windows machines we provide a binary wheel (Python 3.5+ only).
However, the `pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`_ package is a
dependency and unfortunately, the official
`pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`__ repository on PyPI contains
only the sources. You can download a
suitable wheel from `Christoph Gohlke's package site
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj>`__. Then use

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install [path-to-wheel]/pyprojâ€‘*.whl

If you're using `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__
(recommended), it gets much simpler

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyproj
    pip install pycraf

.. note::

    If you are desperate, you can install pycraf from source even on Windows.
    You'll need to install a suitable C-compiler; <see here
    <https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/python_msvc.html#visual-studio-versions-used-to-compile-distributed-python-binaries>`__. The pycraf
    package needs Python 3.5 or later, which means VC++ Version 14 is
    mandatory. The easiest way to obtain it, is by installing the
    `Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools
    <http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`__ which is
    "only" 4 GBytes large...


.. _macos_install:

Installation on MacOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For installation on MacOS you'll have to install gcc-6. The clang compiler
seems not to support OpenMP in a way that is needed by pycraf:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install gcc6
    brew link --overwrite gcc@6

Then proceed as usual with

.. code-block:: bash

    # if on Anaconda, install pyproj the easy way:
    conda install -c conda-forge pyproj

    # then
    pip install pycraf

.. _testing_installed_pycraf:

Testing an installed pycraf
----------------------------

The easiest way to test your installed version of pycraf is running
correctly is to use the `~pycraf.test()` function::

    >>> import pycraf  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> pycraf.test()  # doctest: +SKIP

To run the tests for one sub-package, e.g., `conversions`, only::

    >>> import pycraf  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> pycraf.test('conversions')  # doctest: +SKIP

The tests should run and print out any failures, which you can report at
the `pycraf issue tracker <http://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/issues>`__.

.. note::

    This way of running the tests may not work if you do it in the
    pycraf source distribution directory.

.. note::

    By default, the `test` function will skip over tests that require
    data from the internet. One can include them by::

        >>> import pycraf  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> pycraf.test(remote_data='any')  # doctest: +SKIP

If you prefer testing on the command line and usually work with the source
code, you can also do

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py test

    # to run tests from a sub-package
    python setup.py test -P conversions

    # include tests, which need to download data (will slow down tests)
    python setup.py test --remote-data=any

.. _srtm_data:

Using SRTM data
---------------

To make full use of the path attenuation calculations provided by pycraf,
we recommend to use NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
`(SRTM) data <https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/>`__ for height-profile
generation. pycraf can work with so-called `.hgt` files, a very simple binary
format. Each .hgt file, a so-called tile, just contains 1201x1201 16-bit
integers. From the file naming scheme, one can infer the associated
coordinates. Most tiles contain one square-degree.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide SRTM data as part of the package, due to the
large file sizes and legal reasons. But once you downloaded the necessary
tiles (all or only a subset appropriate for your region), simply define the
environment variable `SRTMDATA`, let it point to the folder containing the
tiles, and pycraf will find the files when it is imported from Python.
