Overview
--------

Pytheos provides a versatile tool set for calculating pressure from number of
built-in pressure scales, converting pressure scales, and fitting pressure-volume
and pressure-volume-temperature data sets.

It provides robust uncertainty propagations using the uncertainties package.

It provides flexible fitting using the lmfit package.  Pytheos allows for fitting
using a wide range of equations and their combinations.

Install
-------

Pytheos is a pure python package, and can be installed from source or with
``pip install pytheos``.

Anaconda users may try: ``conda install -c shdshim pytheos``.

Contact
-------

You may contact Dan Shim (shdshim@gmail.com) for bug reports, comments, and
suggestions.  I am happy to include your new pressure scales or other pressure
scales as well.

Examples and Tutorials
----------------------

The pytheos package includes examples in Jupyter Notebook (under the examples
folder), which demonstrate a range of operations, calculations, and fittings
you can make with pytheos. Pytheos is designed to support data
analysis using Jupyter Notebook as well as python scripts.

Documentation is available at: https://shdshim.github.io/pytheos-docs/.
