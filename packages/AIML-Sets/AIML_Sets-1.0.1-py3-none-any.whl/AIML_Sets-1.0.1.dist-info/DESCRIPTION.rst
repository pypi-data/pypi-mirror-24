Free AIML Rule Sets
===================

This is a collection of open-sourced AIML (Artificial Intelligence
Markup Language) rule sets, for use with any compatible AIML
conversational engine. The files have been repackaged into a single repo
for easy download and installation. I plan to eventually distribute this
on the Python Package Index to make it installable with Python's package
installer, pip, making it easily available for use with `AIML
Bot <https://github.com/hosford42/aiml_bot>`__.
