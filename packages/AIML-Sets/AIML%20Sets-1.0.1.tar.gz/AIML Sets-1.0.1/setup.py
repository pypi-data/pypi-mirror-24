# Free AIML Rule Sets

This is a collection of open-sourced AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup
Language) rule sets, for use with any compatible AIML conversational engine.
The files have been repackaged into a single repo for easy download and
installation. I plan to eventually distribute this on the Python Package
Index to make it installable with Python's package installer, pip, making
it easily available for use with [AIML
Bot](https://github.com/hosford42/aiml_bot).
