Getting Started
---------------

post-review is able to determine your git service automatically. There is a one-time setup 
that is required to fetch your git service API keys -- but post-review will instruct you at this
step.

The quickest way to get started is to just run the ``post-review`` command::

    $ post-review --target <target_branch>


Assuming you are using GitLab Hosted, this is what you will see for your one time setup::

    $ post-review --target <target_branch>

    (One Time Setup) Please create a Personal Access Token
    https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens
    Scope: API, Expires: Never

    Please enter your Personal Access Token: <paste_your_token_here>

The above requires you to navigate to the GitLab link to create an access token.
You will need to use the API scope and make sure that it does not expire -- or can rotate too.
This allows grants permission for post-review to create a merge request.
