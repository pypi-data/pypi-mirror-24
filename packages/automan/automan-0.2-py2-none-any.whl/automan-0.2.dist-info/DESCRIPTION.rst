Features
--------

For a set of numerical simulations with a Python script one can:

- run all simulations and produce all figures with one command.
- distribute the simulations on a collection of idle computers.


The package name
----------------

The name automan comes from an old serial with the same name.  Most
other names were taken on pypi.
