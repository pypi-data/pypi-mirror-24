Description: 
        
        Since 3.0 pagure offers a way to customize the creation and compilation the of
        the gitolite configuration file.
        
        This project hosts the logic to generate gitolite's configuration file for
        dist-git which has a different access model than regular projects on pagure (for
        example, forced pushed is forbidden).
